{"companyName": "FLANIGANS ENTERPRISES INC", "filedAt": "2023-12-29T16:51:14-05:00", "item_1a": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment.\n\n&#160;\n\nCertain statements in this report contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow, capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflect management&#8217;s current expectations regarding future events and use words such as &#8220;anticipate&#8221;, &#8220;believe&#8221;, &#8220;expect&#8221;, &#8220;may&#8221;, &#8220;will&#8221; and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of the date they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materially from management&#8217;s expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic \n\n&#160;\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Had A Significant Impact On Our Operations Since March 2020 And Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Future Business And Financial Results. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related suggested and mandated social distancing and &#8220;shelter-in-place&#8221; orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively, &#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) caused significant disruptions to our business, adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future, particularly if further government directives are put in place for a significant amount of time. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have experienced significant issues relating to suppliers and labor impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers&#8217; employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such as travel limitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe impact of COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business \n\n&#160; \n\nIf we are unable to staff and retain qualified restaurant and package liquor store management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. \n\n&#160; \n\n12&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nSimilar to the broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, and our ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers&#8217; demand could be limited, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have experienced and continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing business will significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance . \n\nIncreases in minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affecting labor costs and a diminishing pool of potential staff members when the unemployment rate falls and legal immigration is restricted, especially in certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe believe the United States federal government may significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate the tip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. The State of Florida has already enacted a minimum wage and tip credit, with the minimum wage currently at $12.00 per hour and a tip credit of $3.02 per hour. The minimum wage increases $1.00 per hour annually until it reaches $15.00 per hour in 2027. The tip credit does not increase. In addition to increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages and other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ a large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs. Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase their price for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs. Additionally, while our employees are not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements, union organizers may engage in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to unionize, our labor costs could increase and it could negatively impact our culture, reduce our flexibility and disrupt our business. In addition, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants.\n\nOur labor expenses include significant costs related to our health benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficult to project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, may cause health care costs to vary substantially from year-over-year. Given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nAny significant changes to the healthcare insurance system could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWhile we try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respond to increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur Sales and Profit Growth Could Be Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales or They May Decrease. \n\n&#160;\n\nWhile future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2024 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.\n\n&#160;\n\n13&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; perceptions of the Flanigan&#8217;s brand; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other dining options; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAs a result, it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases.\n\n&#160;\n\nHigh Unemployment, Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance. \n\n&#160;\n\nCOVID-19 has had a significant impact on domestic economies and will likely continue to negatively impact these economies for some time. Dining out is a discretionary expense. In addition to COVID-19, factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions (including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability in the housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nIntense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe restaurant and package liquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts.\n\n&#160;\n\nAny inability to compete successfully with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability.\n\n&#160;\n\nNew Information Or Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues. \n\n&#160;\n\nRegulations and consumer eating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and cities are enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.\n\n14&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdverse Public Or Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us. \n\n&#160; \n\nRestaurant operators have received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations.\n\n&#160; \n\nOur Inability To Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe utilize menu price increases to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have not experienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases.\n\n&#160;\n\nIncreases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services Due to Inflation May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur operating margins depend on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services due to inflation. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control caused by inflation. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\n\n&#160;\n\nShortages or Interruptions in the Supply of Food Offering Ingredients and/or Liquor Inventory Could Adversely Affect our Operating Results. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory. We may experience shortages, delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather, natural disasters, labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond our control. In addition, we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients, including baby back ribs. Although we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory, shortages or interruptions in our supply of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory could adversely affect our financial results.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner. \n\n&#160;\n\nTo grow successfully, we must open new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant and/or package liquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened our new limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) for business, as well as our company owned package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and our newly built stand-alone package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for business, replacing our package liquor store destroyed by fire which previously operated at that site. During our fiscal year 2023, we also continued constructing a stand-alone building on the same site in Hollywood, Florida adjacent to Store #19P, replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire which previously operated at that site (Store #19R). We anticipate that the restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) will open for business in March 2024.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur ability to open and profitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\n&#160;\n\n15&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nChanges In Customer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance. \n\n&#160;\n\nChanging customer preferences, tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Success Depends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe we have built a reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer.\n\n&#160; \n\nOur Marketing And Advertising Strategies May Not Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business. \n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we introduce new advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers in the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect.\n\n&#160;\n\nLabor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur employees are essential to our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs.\n\n&#160;\n\nDue To Our Geographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nAll but one (1) of our restaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season, (June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf We Were to Experience Widespread Difficulty Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected. \n\n&#160;\n\nMost of the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins.\n\n&#160;\n\nDue To Our Geographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate. \n\n&#160;\n\nDue to the anticipated active hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. We secured windstorm insurance coverage for the period commencing December 30, 2023 at a higher premium. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of windstorm insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.\n\n&#160;\n\n16&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Inability or Failure to Execute a Comprehensive Business Continuity Plan at our Restaurant Support Centers Following a Disaster or Force Majeure Event could have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business. \n\n&#160; \n\nMany of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant and package liquor store operations are centralized at one location. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisis-level events, including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information and the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting, planning for and protecting against the threat. As a result, our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security may not adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss.\n\n&#160;\n\nInability To Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe take pride in our ability to attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return and results may be negatively affected.\n\n&#160; \n\nA Failure To Comply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to regulation by federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; employment; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; building construction and access; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; zoning requirements; and ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; the environment. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nOur facilities are licensed and subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future.\n\n&#160;\n\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business can be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negatively impact public perception of our brands.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are required to comply with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants.\n\n17&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with the construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities.\n\nFailure to comply with these and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nWe May Face Liability Under Dram Shop Statutes. \n\nOur sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to &#8220;dram shop&#8221; statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. There are currently no &#8220;dram shop&#8221; claims pending against us. See &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8212;Government Regulation&#8221; for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.\n\nConcerns relating to pandemics and other diseases, food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our food supply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our customer traffic and ability to operate our restaurants and may do so again in the foreseeable future. Future pandemics and other diseases may have a similar or more severe impact.\n\nIn years past, several nationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of &#8220;mad cow&#8221; disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline.\n\nInstances of food-borne illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business.\n\nIf We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers&#8217; Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We have not experienced any security breaches to date.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf We Experience a Significant Failure in or Interruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business Could Be Adversely Impacted. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe use a variety of applications and systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure. The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling, training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarily on a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions, receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Our ability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systems and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whether from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\n\n&#160;\n\n18&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Effect of Recent Changes to U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe offer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our labor costs significantly. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results.\n\nGovernmental Regulation in One or More of the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability to Open New Restaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs. \n\nEmployment and Immigration Regulations \n\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers&#8217; compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S. healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.\n\nWe also are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time, the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the &#8220;E-Verify&#8221; program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.\n\nOn the other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.\n\n19&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nAdditionally, while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Similar State Laws \n\nWe are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection with ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.\n\nNutrition and Food Regulation \n\nIn recent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or make other nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reform law went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers&#8217; buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.\n\nPrivacy/Cybersecurity \n\nWe are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.\n\nLocal Licensure, Zoning and Other Regulation \n\nEach of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\n\nEnvironmental Laws \n\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws.\n\nWe Could Be Party To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material Money Damages and Other Remedies. \n\nWe could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices.\n\n20&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.\n\nOur Success May Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel. \n\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002. August Bucci, Jeffrey Kastner and Christopher O&#8217;Neil, our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Package Operations, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci, since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner and 2016 in the case of Mr. O&#8217;Neil, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.\n\nWe Are Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity. \n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough we maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experience financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. &#160; If our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial losses and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\nIf There is a Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits Could Be Negatively Affected and our Systems may be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies. \n\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financial systems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems, including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient to effectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenance over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital.\n\nMoreover, these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruption from hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches, or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could result in interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations.\n\n21&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nActs of Violence at or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situations and Terrorism, Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, Which Could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance. \n\nAny act of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic and make it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nThe occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses, and the protest of future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending. Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurants or the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increases to help preserve our operating margins.\n\nSocial Media Impact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand. \n\nThe considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated. The adverse impact of publicity on customers&#8217; perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impact of any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished.\n\nOur Digital Business, Which Has Become an Increasingly Significant Part of Our Business, is Subject to Risks. \n\nPrimarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially. While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implemented technology, targeted advertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If we do not continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential. We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties, or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for order fulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery business is competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.\n\nOur Institutional Lender No Longer Originates, Renews or Modifies loans at LIBOR Effective January 1, 2022. \n\n&#160;\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, our institutional lender no longer originates, renews or modifies loans at LIBOR, except in limited situations. As of September 30, 2023, we had one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The variable rate debt instrument is equal to the lender&#8217;s BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50%) per annum. As a means of managing our interest rate risk on the debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third party lender to convert this variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAs a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item 1B.\n\n&#160;\n\n22&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ", "item_7": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the captions &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;. In addition, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the 2023 and 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\n\n&#160;\n\n32&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOVERVIEW \n\nFinancial Information Concerning Industry Segments \n\nOur business is conducted principally in two segments: the restaurant segment and the package liquor store segment. Financial information broken into these two principal industry segments for the two fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 is set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements which are attached hereto.\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we (i) operated 31 units, consisting of restaurants, sports bar, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchises an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores.\n\n&#160;\n\nFranchised Units . In exchange for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks \"Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill\" and \"Big Daddy's Liquors\", our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1% of gross package liquor sales and 3% of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5% to 3% of all gross sales based upon our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales.\n\n&#160;\n\nAffiliated Limited Partnership Owned Units . We manage and control the operations of the ten restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee. Accordingly, the results of operations of all limited partnership owned restaurants, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations for accounting purposes. The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method.\n\n&#160;\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160;\n\nREVENUES (in thousands): \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; -----------------------52 Weeks Ended----------------------- &#160; &#160; &#160; September 30, 2023 &#160; &#160; October 1, 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Amount &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (In thousands) &#160; &#160; Percent &#160; &#160; (In thousands) &#160; &#160; Percent &#160; Restaurant food sales &#160; $ 107,238 &#160; &#160; &#160; 62.56 &#160; &#160; $ 97,429 &#160; &#160; &#160; 62.73 &#160; Restaurant bar sales &#160; &#160; 29,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16.92 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26,198 &#160; &#160; &#160; 16.87 &#160; Package store sales &#160; &#160; 35,187 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20.52 &#160; &#160; &#160; 31,692 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20.40 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Sales &#160; $ 171,425 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.00 &#160; &#160; $ 155,319 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.00 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Franchise related revenues &#160; &#160; 1,857 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,826 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Rental income &#160; &#160; 951 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 814 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other operating income &#160; &#160; 163 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 173 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total Revenue &#160; $ 174,396 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $ 158,132 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n33&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues. Total revenue for our fiscal year 2023 increased $16,264,000 or 10.29% to $174,396,000 from $158,132,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to increased package liquor store and restaurant sales, increased menu prices, revenue generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022, the opening of the package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) in December 2022, the opening of the package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) in March, 2023 and the comparatively less adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations for our current fiscal year. Additionally, effective March 26, 2023 we increased menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.06% and effective March 19, 2023 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65% annually, to offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses (collectively the &#8220;Recent Price Increases&#8221;). Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022. We note that the Recent Price Increases also contributed to our increased revenues\n\n&#160;\n\nRestaurant Food Sales . Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food, including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants totaled $107,238,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to $97,429,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in restaurant food sales for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to restaurant food sales during our fiscal year 2022 is attributable to the Recent Price Increases, restaurant food sales generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the comparatively greater adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the our fiscal year 2022 as compared with our fiscal year 2023. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us and nine restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25), Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub, (Store #30), and Sunrise, Florida location (Store #85), which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, respectively) was $1,734,000 and $1,798,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 3.56%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for Company owned restaurants only was $835,000 and $886,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 5.76%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only, (excluding Store #25 which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and Store #85 which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022), was $898,000 and $912,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, a decrease of 1.54%. We expect that restaurant food sales, including non-alcoholic beverages, for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased restaurant traffic, Store #25 being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024.\n\n&#160;\n\nRestaurant Bar Sales . Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled $29,000,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to $26,198,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in restaurant bar sales during our fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to the Recent Price Increases, restaurant bar sales generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the comparatively greater adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the our fiscal year 2022 as compared with our fiscal year 2023. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us and nine restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25), Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub (Store #30), and Sunrise, Florida (Store #85), which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, respectively) was $481,000 for our fiscal year 2023 and $487,000 for our fiscal year 2022, a decrease of 1.23%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company owned restaurants only was $196,000 and $211,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 7.11%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $286,000 and $276,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, an increase of 3.62%. We expect that restaurant bar sales for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased restaurant traffic, Store #25 being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024.\n\n&#160;\n\nPackage Liquor Store Sales . Revenue generated from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled $35,187,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to $31,692,000 for our fiscal year 2022, an increase of $3,495,000. This increase was primarily due to increased package liquor store traffic due to what appears to be continued increased demand for package liquor store products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and package liquor sales generated from the opening of our package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) in December 2022 and the opening of our package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) in March, 2023. The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales, which includes nine (9) Company-owned package liquor stores, (excluding Store #19P, which was closed for our fiscal year 2022 due to a fire on October 2, 2018 but re-opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and excluding Store #24 which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023), was $631,000 and $609,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, an increase of 3.61%. We expect that package liquor store sales for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased package liquor store traffic and the operation of the package liquor stores located at 7990 Davie Road Extension, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) which opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and located at 11225 Miramar Parkway #245, Miramar, Florida (Store #24), which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the entire fiscal year.\n\n&#160;\n\n34&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Costs and Expenses . Operating costs and expenses, (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses), for our fiscal year 2023 increased $16,169,000 or 10.69% to $167,372,000 from $151,203,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased payroll, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting process and an expected general increase in food costs, costs and expenses incurred from the opening of the package liquor stores in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) and Miramar, Florida (Store #24), during our fiscal year 2023, the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) during our fiscal year 2023, and the operation of our Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub (Store #30) and limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) for our entire fiscal year 2023 but only a part of our fiscal year 2022, partially offset by actions taken by management to reduce and/or control costs. We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will increase through our fiscal year 2024 primarily due to our package liquor stores in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) and Miramar, Florida (Store #24) being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024, our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024. Operating costs and expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue to approximately 95.97% in our fiscal year 2023 from 95.62% in fiscal year 2022.\n\nGross Profit . Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales.\n\nRestaurant Food and Bar Sales . Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year 2023 increased to $90,750,000 from $79,072,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales), was 66.61% for our fiscal year 2023 and 63.96% for our fiscal year 2022. Gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales increased during our fiscal year 2023 when compared to our fiscal year 2022 due to decreases in our cost of ribs and the Recent Price Increases, partially offset by among other things, higher food costs.\n\nPackage Store Sales . Gross profit for package store sales for our fiscal year 2023 increased to $9,377,000 from $8,382,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Our gross profit margin, (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales), for package store sales was 26.65% for our fiscal year 2023 and 26.45% for our fiscal year 2022. We anticipate that the gross profit margin for package liquor store merchandise will remain stable during our fiscal year 2024.\n\nPayroll and Related Costs . Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2023 increased $6,871,000 or 13.81% to $56,607,000 from $49,736,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2023 were higher due primarily to the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85), and Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub (Store #30) during our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25), the retail package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P), and the retail package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) for a part of our fiscal year 2023 only and higher salaries to employees to remain competitive with other potential employees in a tight labor market. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total revenue was 32.46% for our fiscal year 2023 and 31.45% of total revenue for our fiscal year 2022.\n\nOccupancy Costs . Occupancy costs (consisting of percentage rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes, amortization of leasehold purchases and rent expense associated with operating lease liabilities under ASC 842) for our fiscal year 2023 increased $535,000 or 7.61% to $7,566,000 from $7,031,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in occupancy costs was primarily due to the payment of rent for our retail package liquor store located at 11225 Miramar Parkway, #250, Miramar, Florida (Store #24), our restaurant location located at 11225 Miramar Parkway, #250, Miramar, Florida (Store #25) and Brendan&#8217;s Sports Pub (Store #30) during our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate expenses, including but not limited to advertising, insurance, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for our fiscal year 2023 increased $5,330,000 or 18.29% to $31,901,000 from $26,571,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to Store #85 and Store #30 being open for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and Store #19P, Store #24and Store #25 being open during a part of our fiscal year 2023 only, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting process, inflation and otherwise to increases in expenses across all categories. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will increase during our fiscal year 2024 due primarily to increases across all categories. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue in our fiscal year 2023 to 18.29% as compared to 16.80% in our fiscal year 2022.\n\n35&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for our fiscal year 2023, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, increased $572,000 or 18.99% to $3,584,000 from $3,012,000 from our fiscal year 2022. This increase is driven by the opening of Stores #19P, #24, and #25. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 2.06% of revenue for our fiscal year 2023 and 1.90% of revenue for our fiscal year 2022.\n\nInterest Expense, Net . Interest expense, net, for our fiscal year 2023 increased $310,000 to $1,067,000 from $757,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Interest expense, net, increased for our fiscal year 2023 due to the interest on our borrowing of $8,900,000 from an unrelated third party lender to re-finance the mortgage loan on our property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida (Store #31) and due to interest on our borrowing of $1,100,000 from a related third party lender to re-finance the mortgage loan on our property located at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (Store #22) during our fiscal year 2022.\n\nIncome Taxes. Income tax for our fiscal year 2023 was an expense of $649,000, as compared to an expense of $763,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes increased for our fiscal year 2023 (10.70%) as compared to our fiscal year 2022 (7.78%).\n\nNet Income. Net income for our fiscal year 2023 decreased $3,633,000 or 40.15% to $5,416,000 from $9,049,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to the higher income attributable to the forgiveness of debt of certain of our PPP Loans during our fiscal year 2022, higher food costs and overall increased expenses during our fiscal year 2023, partially offset by increased revenue at our retail package liquor stores and restaurants during our fiscal year 2023 and the Recent Price Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income for our fiscal year 2023 is 3.11%, as compared to 5.72% for our fiscal year 2022.\n\nNet Income Attributable to Flanigan&#8217;s Enterprise, Inc. Stockholders. Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2023 decreased $2,313,000 or 36.64% to $3,999,000 from $6,312,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to the higher income attributable to the forgiveness of debt of certain of our PPP Loans during our fiscal year 2022, higher food costs and overall increased expenses during our fiscal year 2023, and a higher portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (specifically the operations of our Miramar location), partially offset by increased revenue at our retail package liquor stores and restaurants during our fiscal year 2023 and the Recent Price Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2023 is 2.29%, as compared to 3.99% for our fiscal year 2022.\n\nNew Limited Partnership Restaurants \n\nAs new restaurants open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to advance pre-opening costs, including but not limited to pre-opening rent for the new locations. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened one new restaurant location in Miramar, Florida as a &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s&#8221;.\n\n&#160;\n\nMenu Price Increases and Trends \n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, we increased menu prices for our food offerings (effective March 26, 2023) to target an aggregate increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.06% annually and we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective March 20, 2023) to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65% annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. During the fiscal year 2022, we increased menu prices for our food offerings (effective October 3, 2021 and December 19, 2021, respectively) to target an aggregate increase to our food revenues of approximately 8.83% annually and we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective December 12, 2021) to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 7.80% annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021.\n\n&#160;\n\nCOVID-19 has and will continue to materially and adversely affect our restaurant business for what may be a prolonged period of time. This damage and disruption has resulted from events and factors that were impossible for us to predict and are beyond our control. As a result, COVID-19 has materially adversely affected our results of operations for the fiscal year 2023 and will, in all likelihood, impact our results of operations, liquidity, and/or financial condition throughout our fiscal year 2024. The extent to which our restaurant business may be adversely impacted and its effect on our operations, liquidity and/or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted.\n\n&#160; \n\nBased on current COVID-19 trends, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023.\n\n36&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\nWe fund our operations through cash from operations and borrowings from third parties. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25,532,000, a decrease of $16,606,000 from our cash balance of $42,138,000 as of October 1, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to our decision not to finance our insurance premiums for the annual period beginning December 30, 2022 ($3,281,000), the purchase of properties at Hallandale Beach, Florida ($8,500,000), and El Portal, Florida ($3,200,000), and the continued construction of Store #19R ($1,308,000).\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2021, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the &#8220;LP&#8217;s&#8221;), as well as the store we manage but do not own (the &#8220;Managed Store&#8221;) (collectively, the &#8220;Borrowers&#8221;), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender (the &#8220;Lender&#8221;) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;) under the United States Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.98 million (the &#8220;2 nd PPP Loans&#8221;), of which approximately: (i) $3.46 million was loaned to six (6) of the LP&#8217;s; and (ii) $0.52 million was loaned to the Managed Store. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we applied for forgiveness for all PPP Loans, including the Managed Store, and as of September 30, 2023, the entire amount of principal and accrued interest was forgiven under the 2 nd PPP Loans.\n\n&#160;\n\nInflation is affecting all aspects of our operations, including but not limited to food, beverage, fuel and labor costs. Supply chain issues also contribute to inflation. Inflation, including supply chain issues are having a material impact on our operating results.\n\n&#160;\n\nNotwithstanding the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations, we believe that our current cash availability from our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and borrowed funds will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.\n\n&#160; \n\nCASH FLOWS \n\nThe following table is a summary of our cash flows for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; ---------Fiscal Years-------- &#160; &#160; &#160; 2023 &#160; &#160; 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in thousands) &#160; Net cash provided by operating activities &#160; $ 8,489 &#160; &#160; $ 10,502 &#160; Net cash used in investing activities &#160; &#160; (18,559 ) &#160; &#160; (9,542 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities &#160; &#160; (6,536 ) &#160; &#160; 8,502 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net (Decrease) Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents &#160; &#160; (16,606 ) &#160; &#160; 9,462 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and Cash Equivalents, Beginning &#160; &#160; 42,138 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32,676 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cash and Cash Equivalents, Ending &#160; $ 25,532 &#160; &#160; $ 42,138 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nCapital Expenditures \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to using cash for our operating expenses, we use cash generated from operations and borrowings to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. During the fiscal year 2023, we acquired property and equipment and construction in progress of $20,574,000, (including non-cash items which include $2,390,000 of purchase deposits transferred to property and equipment and $545,000 of purchase deposits transferred to construction in progress and $931,000 of construction in progress in accounts payable) including $367,000 for renovations to three (3) existing limited partnership owned restaurants and $378,000 for renovations to three (3) Company owned restaurants. During our fiscal year 2022, we acquired property and equipment of $12,655,000 (of which $3,849,000 was for construction in progress; $3,258,000 construction in progress transferred to property and equipment; $969,000 construction in progress in accounts payable; $50,000 was deposits recorded in other assets; and $512,000 was deposits transferred to construction in progress as of October 2, 2021), which amount included $937,000 for renovations to three (3) existing limited partnership restaurants and $159,000 for renovations to two (2) Company-owned restaurants.\n\n37&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nDebt \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had long term debt (including the current portion) of $23,128,000, as compared to $25,389,000 as of October 1, 2022. Our long-term debt decreased as of September 30, 2023 as compared to October 1, 2022 because we satisfied the principal balance and all accrued interest ($367,000) due on our $5.5 million term loan. In addition, we did not finance our insurance premiums for our annual insurance renewal effective December 30, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn February 2023, we determined that as of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the required Post-Distribution Basic Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the &#8220;Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant&#8221;) contained in each of our six (6) loans (the &#8220;Institutional Loans&#8221;) with our unrelated third-party institutional lender (the &#8220;Institutional Lender&#8217;). On February 23, 2023, we received from the Institutional Lender, a written waiver of the non-compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant (the &#8220;Covenant Non-Compliance&#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things, the Institutional Lender waived (1) the non-compliance as of December 31, 2022 and (2) their right to exercise certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us thereunder, resulting in the indebtedness under the Institutional Loans to be immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant requires we maintain a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 and for the twelve (12) months ended September 30, 2023 our ratio was calculated to be 1.40 to 1.00. We have prepared projections going forward and expect to be in compliance. As a result, our classification of debt is appropriate as of September 30, 2023.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe repaid long term debt, including auto loans, financial insurance premiums, and mortgages in the amount of $2,299,000 and $3,736,000 in our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n&#160;\n\n(a) Advance on Existing Mortgage Loan &#8211; Fort Lauderdale, Florida \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we requested and received a loan advance of $697,000 from an entity controlled by a member of our Board of Directors, which entity currently holds a first priority mortgage note on our real property and improvements where our restaurant located at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida operates (the &#8220;West Davie Mortgage Note&#8221;). Including the $697,000 advance, the principal amount outstanding amount owed under the West Davie Mortgage Note as of September 30, 2023 is $1,049,000. The West Davie Mortgage Note accrues interest at 6% annually, (increased from 5% annually), is amortizable over 15 years with monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately $9,300 required to be made and a final balloon payment of approximately $487,000 required to be made August 1, 2032.\n\n&#160;\n\n(b) Re-Finance of Mortgage on Real Property &#8211; Hallandale Beach, Florida \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we re-financed our mortgage debt with our non-affiliated third-party lender secured by our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale, Florida where our combination package liquor store and restaurant (Store #31) operates and borrowed an additional $8,012,000 raising the principal balance to $8,900,000, (the &#8220;$8.90M Mortgage&#8221;). The $8.90M Mortgage bears interest at a variable rate equal to the BSBY Screen Rate &#8211; 1 Month plus 1.50%. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk, which fixed the interest rate on the $8.90M Mortgage at 4.90% per annum throughout its term. The $8.90M Mortgage is fully amortized over fifteen (15) years, with our monthly payment of principal and interest totaling $33,000.\n\n&#160;\n\n(c ) Financed Insurance Premiums \n\n&#160; \n\nPrior to fiscal year 2023, we financed our annual insurance premiums. Due to higher interest rates, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the policy year commencing December 30, 2022, we paid the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability and terrorist policies, totaling approximately $3.281 million, in full, which includes coverage for our franchisees (which is $658,000), which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Due to continuing higher interest rates for the policy year commencing December 30, 2023, we will pay the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism policies in full ($3.932 million), which includes coverage for our franchises (approximately $786,000).\n\n&#160;\n\nWe paid the $3.281 million annual premium amounts on January 9, 2023, which includes coverage for our franchisees which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We secured property insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policy on December 30, 2023. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of property insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.)\n\n&#160;\n\nConstruction Contracts \n\n&#160;\n\n(a) 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19 &#8211; &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s&#8221;) \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party architect for design and development services totaling $77,000 for the re-build of our restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), which has been closed since October 2, 2018 due to damages caused by a fire, of which $62,000 has been paid. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor to re-build our restaurant at this location totaling $2,515,000 and during our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders increasing the total contract price by $1,021,000 to $3,536,000, of which $1,534,000 has been paid through September 30, 2023 and $1,090,000 has been paid subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023.\n\n&#160; \n\n38&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(b) 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida (Store #85- \"Flanigan's') \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for exterior renovations at this location totaling $343,000 and through the end of our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement increasing the total contract price by $327,000 to $670,000, of which the full amount has been paid as of the end of our fiscal year 2023.\n\n&#160; \n\nPurchase Commitments/Supply \n\n&#160;\n\nIn order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar years 2023 and 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $7.0 million of &#8220;2.25 &#38; Down Baby Back Ribs&#8221; (industry jargon for the weight range in which slabs of baby back ribs are sold) from this vendor during calendar year 2023, at a prescribed cost, which we believe is competitive. The increase in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2024 compared to calendar year 2023 is due to the increase in volume of our purchase of ribs for Store #25, Miramar, Florida being open for the entire calendar year and Store #19, Hollywood, Florida anticipated to be open for a part of the calendar year, offset by a decrease in market price.\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.\n\n&#160;\n\nFlanigan&#8217;s Fish Company, LLC \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, Flanigan&#8217;s Fish Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (&#8220;FFC&#8221;) supplies certain of the fish to all of our restaurants. Since we hold the controlling interest of FFC, the balance sheet and operating results of this entity are consolidated into the accompanying financial statements of the Company. Sales and purchases of fish are recognized in restaurant food sales and restaurant and lounges (cost of merchandise sold), respectively, in the consolidated statements of income at the time of sale to the restaurant. In addition, the 49% of FFC owned by the unrelated third party is recognized as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.\n\n&#160;\n\nPurchase of Limited Partnership Interests \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring our fiscal year 2023, we did not purchase any limited partnership interests. During our fiscal year 2022 we purchased 74 limited partnership units (7.4% limited partnership interest) in CIC Investors #85, Ltd. (Store #85).\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nWorking Capital \n\n&#160;\n\nThe table below summarizes the current assets, current liabilities, and working capital as of the end of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022. &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Item &#160; Sep 30, 2023 &#160; &#160; Oct. 1, 2022 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in Thousands) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Current Assets &#160; $ 35,294 &#160; &#160; $ 50,893 &#160; Current Liabilities &#160; &#160; 22,371 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22,176 &#160; Working Capital &#160; $ 12,923 &#160; &#160; $ 28,717 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nOur working capital decreased as of September 30, 2023 from our working capital as of October 1, 2022 primarily due to increases in (i) cash purchases of real property; (ii) cash purchases of property and equipment; and (iii) deposits on property and equipment. Current assets as of October 1, 2022 increased due to our increased borrowings resulting from the Hallandale Mortgage Debt and the West Davie Mortgage Debt, significant portions of which we classified as long term liabilities as of September 30, 2023. Current assets as of September 30, 2023 decreased due to our decision not to finance our insurance premiums for the annual period beginning December 30, 2022, as well as the current year investments in the purchase of property.\n\n&#160;\n\n39&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile there can be no assurance due to, among other things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and borrowed funds will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year 2024. \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring our fiscal year 2024, we plan to use certain funds on-hand, borrowed funds, and/or insurance proceeds to complete the construction of our new building on the real property we own located at 2505 N. University Drive Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) where we plan to operate our &#8220;Flanigan&#8217;s&#8221; restaurant. There can be no assurance as to the timing for us to complete the construction of the restaurant for Store #19R.\n\n&#160;\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n&#160;\n\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \n\n&#160; \n\nRecently Adopted \n\n&#160; \n\nThere are no accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted.\n\n&#160;\n\nIssued \n\n&#160;\n\nThe FASB issued guidance, ASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedient and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (&#8220;IBORs&#8221;) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London interbank offered rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. This accounting standards update provides companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. LIBOR rates were published until June 30, 2023. All principal and interest of the Term Loan was paid during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, so the discontinuance of LIBOR rates will have no impact on us.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe FASB issued guidance, ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance would be effective for the Company in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2024; however, after performing a thorough analysis the Company concluded there is no material impact.\n\n&#160;\n\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\n&#160; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\n&#160;\n\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n\n&#160;\n\nEstimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment \n\n&#160;\n\nThe estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates. Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material. In addition, periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material. We estimate the useful life of those assets by considering, among other things, expected use, life of the lease on the building, and warranty period, if applicable. The assets are then depreciated using a straight-line method over those estimated lives. These estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary. Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary.\n\n&#160;\n\n40&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidation of Limited Partnerships \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we operate ten (10) restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants. We expect that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner. In addition to the general partnership interest we also purchased limited partnership units ranging from 0% to 49% of the total units outstanding. As a result of these controlling interests, we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of 50% of the equity interests. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160;\n\nWe account for our income taxes using FASB ASC Topic 740, &#8220; Income Taxes &#8221;, which requires among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and tax credits to the extent that realization of said tax benefits is more likely than not. For discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year 2023.\n\n&#160; \n\nLeases \n\n&#160;\n\nEffective September 29, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (&#8220;ASC 842&#8221;), which requires that lease arrangements be presented on the lessee&#8217;s balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the related future minimum lease payments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using the modified retrospective approach. This standard had a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income due to the escalations of rent in the extensions but did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Estimates associated with leases include lease classification, discount rate and lease term.\n\n&#160;\n\nLoyalty Programs \n\n&#160;\n\nWe offer loyalty programs to customers of our restaurants and package liquor stores. The gift cards distributed as a part of our loyalty programs have expiration dates and we estimate breakage for such gift cards.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Matters \n\n&#160;\n\nImpact of Inflation \n\n&#160;\n\nThe primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs. Inflation is having a material impact on our operating results, especially rising food, fuel and labor costs.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ", "item_7a": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. As more fully described in Note 15 &#8220;Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks. These instruments are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate obligations into fixed rate obligations.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt September 30, 2023, we had one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The interest rate of our variable rate debt instrument is equal to the lender&#8217;s BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50%) per annum. The debt instrument further provides that the &#8220;BSBY Screen Rate is a rate of interest equal to the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Interest Rate or successor thereto approved by the lender. In September 2022, we refinanced the mortgage loan encumbering the property where our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida, (Store #31) operates, which mortgage loan is held by an unaffiliated third-party lender (the &#8220;$8.90M Loan&#8221;).\n\n&#160;\n\nAs a means of managing our interest rate risk on this debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third-party lender to convert this variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate. We are currently party to the following interest rate swap agreement:\n\n&#160;\n\n41&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n(i) The interest rate swap agreement entered into in September 2022 relates to the $8.90M Loan (the &#8220;$8.90M Term Loan Swap&#8221;). The $8.90M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a fifteen (15) year period at a fixed rate of 4.90% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $8,900,000, while receiving interest for the same period at BSBY Screen Rate &#8211; 1 Month, plus 1.50%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. As of September 30, 2023 the fair value of the swap agreement is now reflected on the balance sheet in other assets and accumulated other comprehensive income. We determined that the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and that changes in fair value will be adjusted quarterly based on the valuation statement.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring our fiscal year 2023, we invested the aggregate sum of $900,000 in 90-day certificates of deposit, fully government guaranteed and at an average fixed annual interest rate of 4.87%. Otherwise, as on September 30, 2023, our cash resources offset our bank charges and any excess cash resources earn interest at variable rates. Accordingly, our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates.\n\n&#160;\n\nThere is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START "}
