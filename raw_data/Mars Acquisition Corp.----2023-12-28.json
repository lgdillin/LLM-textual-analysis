Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, Mars&#8217; management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on Mars&#8217;s behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\n\nOverview \n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on April 23, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.\n\nResults of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events \n\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the IPO, and activities related to identifying ScanTech as the target for the Business Combination. Since our IPO, we have not generated any operating revenues and do not intend to until after completion of the Business Combination, except for the non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held in the Trust Account.\n\nWe incurred expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses as we conducted due diligence on prospective business combination candidates, including ScanTech.\n\nWe expect to incur additional costs in the pursuit of the Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete the Business Combination will be successful.\n\nLiquidity, Capital Resources Going Concern \n\nOur Registration Statement for the IPO was declared effective on February 13, 2023. On February 16, 2023, we consummated the IPO of 6,900,000 Units, including 900,000 additional Units issued pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $69,000,000.\n\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the sale of the Units, Mars consummated the Private Placement of 391,000 Units, each Private Placement Unit consisting of one Ordinary Share and one Right, to our Sponsor, Mars Capital Holding Corporation, a British Virgin Islands business company with limited liability, at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,910,000.\n\nFollowing the closing of the IPO on February 16, 2023, an amount of $70,380,000 ($10.20 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Placement was placed in the Trust Account. The funds held in the Trust Account may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account.\n\nWe intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, to complete the Business Combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete the Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of ScanTech, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nThe funds held outside the Trust Account have been used primarily used for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting the Business Combination, as well as legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements. For the year ended September 30, 2023, we incurred expenses in the amount of $521,582.\n\nThe funds held outside of the Trust Account may not be sufficient to allow Mars to operate for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of the financial statements. We may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our Sponsor, an affiliate of our Sponsor, officers, directors, or third parties. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest bearing basis as may be required. If we complete the Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Other than as described above, the terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account.\n\nIf we cannot complete the Business Combination by February 16, 2024, we will need to extend the period of time to consummate a business combination to August 16, 2024. We may need to obtain additional financing if we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon the Extension or the completion of the Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with the Extension or the Business Combination. If we are unable to complete the Extension or the Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we may be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following the Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.\n\nThere is no assurance that our plans to consummate the Business Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, there is substantial doubt about Mars&#8217; ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements \n\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\n\nContractual Obligations \n\nWe do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities.\n\nOur Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combination targets. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.\n\nIn addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended business combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete the Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account.\n\nOur Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Mars Memorandum and Articles of Association (i) to modify the substance or timing of Mars&#8217; obligation to allow redemption in connection with the our initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if we do not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust account and not previously released to pay taxes, divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares.\n\nOur Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares it will receive if we fail to complete the Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if we fail to complete the Business Combination within the Combination Period. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the public offering price per Unit ($10.20).\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units and Units that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Right) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to signed prior to or on the effective date of the IPO requiring us to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain &#8220;piggy-back&#8221; registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:\n\nRepresentative shares \n\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the representative shares issued as part of the Company&#8217;s IPO. This estimate was derived by calculating a ratio of the individual share price to the overall unit price of other companies with similar equity structures. This ratio was applied to the Company&#8217;s initial share price of $10.00 per unit. Any deviations or modifications to the fair value estimation process are disclosed in the financial statements to provide investors with insight into the potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOrdinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption \n\nThe Company accounts for its Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 &#8220; Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity .&#8221; Conditionally redeemable Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within Mars&#8217; control) are classified as temporary equity. The Company&#8217;s public shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of Mars&#8217; control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023, Ordinary Shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value of $10.52 per share as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders&#8217; equity section of Mars&#8217; balance sheet. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Ordinary Shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable Ordinary Shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital or accumulated deficit if additional paid in capital equals to zero.\n\n", "item_7a": " Item 7A.
