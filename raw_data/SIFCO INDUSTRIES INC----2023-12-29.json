{"companyName": "SIFCO INDUSTRIES INC", "filedAt": "2023-12-29T17:53:23-05:00", "item_1a": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\nSet forth below are material risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. \n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations \n\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the A&#38;E industries and the continuing or further downturn in these industries could adversely impact the demand for our products. \n\nThe commerc ial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S. and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns and environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators. Residual negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial aerospace industry may continue for a prolonged period of time. We continue to experience changes in demand from our customers in this market and a reduction in demand for commercial aircraft will adversely impact our net sales and operating results. \n\nThere is risk that the industry reintroduces mitigation strategies in response to residual impacts from COVID-19, which could include reduced capacity and shifting route patterns. Furthermore, airlines may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel due to travel restrictions and/or social distancing requirements. The residual impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic also has increased uncertainty with respect to global trade volumes, which could put negative pressure on cargo traffic levels. Any of these factors would have a significant impact on the demand within the commercial aerospace industry. In addition, a lengthy period of reduced industry-wide demand for commercial aircraft could put additional pressure on our suppliers, resulting in increased procurement costs and/or additional supply chain disruption. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic or its aftermath further impacts demand for our products and services or impairs the viability of some of our customers and/or suppliers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected, and those impacts could be material. \n\nThe military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; as well as the effects of terrorism, a changing global political environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines. Accordingly, the timing, duration and severity of cyclical upturns and downturns cannot be forecast with certainty. Downturns or reductions in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe energy industry is also cyclical in nature. Demand for our new and spare components in this industry is, in turn, driven by the global demand for energy, which is affected by, among other factors, the state of the world economies, the political environments of numerous countries and environmental constraints. The availability of alternative energy to oil and gas, and related prices, also have a large impact on demand. Reductions in demand for products in this market could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nCyclical declines or sustained weakness in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nGovernment spending priorities and terms may change in a manner adverse to our business. \n\nAt times, our supplying of products to the U.S. military has been adversely affected by significant changes in U.S. defense and national security budgets. Budget changes that result in a decline in overall spending, program delays, program cancellations or a slowing of new program starts on programs in which we participate could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Future levels of expenditures and authorizations for defense-related programs by the U.S. government may decrease, remain constant or shift to programs in areas where we do not currently provide products, thereby reducing the chances that we will be awarded new contracts. \n\nSIFCO has contracts for programs where the period of performance may exceed one year. Congress and certain foreign governments must usually approve funds for a given program each fiscal year and may significantly reduce funding of a program in a particular year. Significant reductions in these appropriations or the amount of new defense contracts awarded may affect our ability to complete contracts, obtain new work and grow our business. At times when there are perceived threats to national security, U.S. defense spending can increase; at other times, defense spending can decrease. Future levels of defense spending are uncertain and subject to congressional debate. Any reduction in future U.S. defense spending levels could adversely impact our sales, operating profit and cash flow. \n\nFurthermore, business conducted pursuant to U.S. government contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. New procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of the portion of our business derived from contracts with the U.S. government. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail, or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with the company without prior notice either at its convenience or for default based on performance, and funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as a part of the appropriations process due to fiscal constraints or due to changes in foreign or domestic policy strategy. \n\nFailure to retain existing contracts or win new contracts under competitive bidding processes may adversely affect our sales. \n\nSIFCO obtains most of its contracts through a competitive bidding process, and substantially all of the business that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive bidding process. Competitive bidding presents a number of risks, including: \n\na. the need to compete against companies or teams of companies with more financial and marketing resources and more experience in bidding on and performing major contracts than we have; \n\nb. the need to compete against companies or teams of companies that may be long-term, entrenched incumbents for a particular contract for which we are competing and that have, as a result, greater domain expertise and better customer relations; \n\nc. the need to compete to retain existing contracts that have in the past been awarded to us on a sole-source basis or that have been incumbent for a long time; \n\nd. the award of contracts to providers offering solutions at the &#8220;lowest price technically acceptable,&#8221; which may lower the profit we may generate under a contract awarded using this pricing method or prevent us from submitting a bid for such work due to us deeming such work to be unprofitable; \n\ne. the reduction of margins achievable under any contracts awarded to us; \n\nf. the need to bid on some programs in advance of the completion of their specifications, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties or increased costs that lower our profitability; \n\ng. the substantial cost and managerial time and effort, including design, development and marketing activities, necessary to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us; \n\nh. the need to develop, introduce and implement new and enhanced solutions to our customers&#8217; needs; \n\ni. the need to locate and contract with teaming partners and subcontractors; \n\nj. the need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any contract that we are awarded; and \n\nk. long term agreements - changes in our cost profile over the life of a long-term agreement. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIf SIFCO wins a contract, and upon expiration, the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, that we will win the contract at the same profit margin, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. \n\nIf SIFCO is unable to consistently retain existing contracts or win new contract awards, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our total backlog, which could reduce our sales in future periods below the levels anticipated, and which makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results. \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, our total backlog w as $120.1 millio n. Orders may be canceled and scope adjustments may occur, and we may not realize the full amounts of sales that we anticipate in our backlog numbers. Further, there is no assurance that our customers will purchase all the orders represented in our backlog, due in part to the U.S. government&#8217;s ability to modify, curtail or terminate major programs. Additionally, the timing of receipt of orders, if any, on contracts included in our backlog could change. The failure to realize amounts reflected in our backlog could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. \n\nSIFCO business is dependent on a few number of direct and indirect customers. \n\nA substantial portion of SIFCO's business is conducted with a relatively small number of large direct and indirect customers. In fiscal 2023, one direct customer accounted for approximately 12% percent of our consolidated net sales and three direct customers and their direct subcontractors accounted for approximately 32% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated net sales. A financial hardship experienced by any one of these key customers, the loss of any of them or a reduction in or substantial delay of orders from any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business. \n\nThe Company's failure to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our existing business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nSIFCO may not be able to identify, attract or retain qualified technical personnel, sales and customer service personnel, employees with expertise in forging, or management personnel to supervise such activities. We may also not attract and retain employees who share the Company's core values, who can maintain and grow our existing business, and who are suited to work in a public company environment, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nThe Company's business could be negatively affected by cybersecurity threats, information systems interruptions, intrusions or new software implementations and other disruptions. \n\nSIFCO faces cyber threats, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures and interruptions, new software implementation, and damaging weather or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises, which may adversely affect our business. \n\nAlthough we continue to review and enhance our systems and cybersecurity controls, SIFCO has experienced and expects to continue to experience cybersecurity threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to the Company&#8217;s sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. Although we maintain information security policies and procedures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, information system disruptions, equipment failures or cybersecurity attacks, such as unauthorized access, malicious software and other intrusions, could still occur and may lead to potential data corruption, exposure of proprietary and confidential information. Further, while SIFCO works cooperatively with its customers, suppliers and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, in addition to our internal processes, procedures and systems, it must also rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities. \n\nAny intrusion, disruption, breach or similar event may cause operational stoppages, fines, penalties, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. \n\nWe continue to provide for remote work for certain of our employees, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. In addition to existing risks, any adoption or deployment of new technologies via acquisitions or internal initiatives may increase our exposure to risks, breaches, or failures, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Furthermore, the Company may have access to sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information that may be subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually-imposed controls. Despite our use of reasonable and appropriate controls, material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming, or \n\nTable of Contents \n\nemployee errors and/or malfeasance could lead to the compromise or improper use of such sensitive, confidential, or personal data or information, resulting in possible negative consequences, such as fines, ransom demands, penalties, loss of reputation, competitiveness or customers, or other negative consequences resulting in adverse impacts to our results of operations or financial condition. \n\nSIFCO relies on our suppliers to meet the quality and delivery expectations of our customers. \n\nThe ability to deliver SIFCO's products on schedule is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials, internal and supplier produced parts and structures, conversion of raw materials into parts and assemblies, and performance of suppliers and others. We rely on numerous third-party suppliers for raw materials and a large proportion of the components used in our production process. Certain of these raw materials and components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers, or similarly, customers&#8217; specifications may require SIFCO to obtain raw materials and/or components from a single source or certain suppliers. Many of our suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources and manufacturing capabilities. We do not currently have the ability to manufacture these components ourselves. Consequently, we risk disruptions in our supply of key products and components if our suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of shortages in raw materials, operational problems, strikes, natural disasters, health crises or other factors. We have and may continue to experience delays in the delivery of such products as a result of increased demands and pressures on the supply chain, customs, labor issues, geopolitical pressures, disruptions associated with changes in political, economic, and social conditions, weather, laws and regulations. Unfavorable fluctuations in price, international trade policies, quality, delivery, and availability of these products could continue to adversely affect the Company's ability to meet demands of customers and cause negative impacts to the Company's cost structure, profitability and its cash flow. If we were unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. \n\nWe may have disputes with our vendors arising from, among other things, the quality of products and services or customer concerns about the vendor. If any of our vendors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. Economic downturns can adversely affect a vendor&#8217;s ability to manufacture or deliver products. Further, vendors may also be enjoined from manufacturing and distributing products to us as a result of litigation filed by third parties, including intellectual property litigation. If SIFCO were to experience difficulty in obtaining certain products, there could be an adverse effect on its results of operations and on its customer relationships and our reputation. Additionally, our key vendors could also increase pricing of their products, which could negatively affect our ability to win contracts by offering competitive prices. \n\nAny material supply disruptions could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under our contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders, penalties, delays in realizing revenues, and payment delays, as well as adversely affect our ongoing product cost structure. \n\nFailure to perform by our subcontractors could materially and adversely affect our contract performance and its ability to obtain future business. \n\nThe performance of contracts often involves subcontractors, upon which we rely to complete delivery of products to our customers. SIFCO may have disputes with subcontractors. A failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily deliver products can adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor. Any subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the customer terminating our contract for default, which could expose us to liability for excess costs of re-procurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts. \n\nThe Company's future success depends on the ability to meet the needs of its customer requirements in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company believes that the commercial A&#38;E markets in which we operate require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities using composite and metallic materials. The Company&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent on our ability to acquire, develop, execute and maintain such sophisticated techniques and capabilities to meet the needs of our customers and to bring those products to market quickly and at cost-effective prices. If we are unable to acquire and/or develop, execute and maintain such techniques and capabilities, we may experience an adverse effect to our business, financial condition or results of operation. \n\nThe Company faces certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity. \n\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products we provide. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of insurance or indemnity may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not possible for SIFCO to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of the indemnification we receive and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nour insurance coverage would harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future. \n\nThe Company's business is subject to risks associated with international operations. \n\nSIFCO has operations in Maniago, Italy and operates internationally. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including: \n\na. fluctuations in U.S. dollar value arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the translation of certain foreign currency subsidiary balances; \n\nb. difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; \n\nc. general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we or our customers operate; \n\nd. other deterioration of economic conditions, including the effect of inflation on our customers and suppliers; \n\ne. limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; \n\nf. restrictions on the repatriation of funds; \n\ng. changes in trade policies, laws, regulations, political leadership and environment, and/or security risks; \n\nh. tariff regulations; \n\ni. difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and compliance with export/import controls and regulations; \n\nj. the risk of government financed competition; \n\nk. compliance with a variety of international laws as well as U.S. regulations, rules and practices affecting the activities of companies abroad; and \n\nl. difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and the required infrastructure costs, including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology. \n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and price sensitive industry, and customer pricing pressures could reduce the demand and/or price for our products and services. \n\nThe end-user markets SIFCO serves are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete globally with a number of domestic and international companies that have substantially greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than we do. Many of SIFCO's customers have the in-house capability to fulfill their manufacturing requirements. SIFCO's larger competitors may be able to vie more effectively for very large-scale contracts than we can by providing different or greater capabilities or benefits such as technical qualifications, past performance on large-scale contracts, geographic presence, price and availability of key professional personnel. If SIFCO is unable to successfully compete for new business, our net sales growth and operating margins may decline. Competitive pricing pressures may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, there can be no assurance that competition from existing or potential competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results. If SIFCO does not continue to compete effectively and win contracts, our future business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to meet its financial obligations may be materially compromised. \n\nThe Company uses estimates when pricing contracts and any changes in such estimates could have an adverse effect on our profitability and our overall financial performance. \n\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, some of which extend for multiple years, SIFCO makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. These projections assess the productivity and availability of labor, complexity of the work to be performed, cost and availability of materials, impact of delayed performance and timing of product deliveries. Contract pricing requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete a contract since costs also include expected increases in wages, prices for materials and allocated fixed costs. Similarly, assumptions are made regarding the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers' assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. \n\nBecause of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts, future period financial reporting and performance, as pass through pricing is not always permissible. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nOur technologies could become obsolete, reducing our revenues and profitability. \n\nTechnologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes and the future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our forging capabilities. SIFCO could encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render its technologies and equipment less profitable or obsolete in our chosen markets and our operating results may suffer. \n\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately or timely report its financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the Company's financial reporting, which would harm the business and the trading price of its common stock. \n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among other things, requires that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our testing has, as described below, and in the future may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline if investors and others lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other applicable regulatory authorities. \n\nAs further described in Item 9A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, management determined that SIFCO&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Management identified deficiencies in its oversight and backup and recovery controls that represent a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. Until remediated, this material weakness could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As with any internal control deficiency, there can be no assurance that our remedial measures will be successful or otherwise sufficient to address the material weakness. If the Company is unable to remediate the material weakness, or is otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company&#8217;s ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject the Company to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, including civil penalties, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. \n\nLabor disruptions by our employees or personnel turnover and/or shortage could adversely affect our business. \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we employed approximately 378 pe ople. We face competition for management and employees from other companies and organizations. If we continue to experience turnover and/or are unable to quickly hire employees and subsequently retain our workforce, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, we may experience increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and our ability to secure new work and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, two of our locations are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Although we have not experienced any material labor-related work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good, labor stoppages may occur in the future. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if SIFCO is unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with the unions, or if other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, higher ongoing labor costs and possible loss of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \n\nThe price and availability of oil and other energy sources worldwide could adversely impact our results of operations. Unexpected pricing of fuel or a shortage of, or disruption in, the supply of fuel or other energy sources could have a material adverse effect on our and our customers' business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nOur results of operations can be directly affected, positively and negatively, by volatility in the cost and availability of energy, which is subject to global supply and demand and other factors beyond our control. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted global energy markets, particularly in Europe, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas and other energy supplies. Our customers' businesses are significantly impacted by the availability and pricing of fuel. Weather-related events, natural disasters, terrorism, wars, political disruption or instability involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental or cartel policy concerning crude oil or aircraft fuel production, labor strikes, cyberattacks or other events affecting refinery production, transportation, taxes, marketing, environmental concerns, market manipulation, price speculation and other unpredictable events may drive actual or perceived fuel supply shortages. In particular, the recent \n\nTable of Contents \n\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused shortages in the availability of fuel. In the event that the supply of natural gas from Russia stops or is significantly reduced, there may be supply disruptions, increased prices, shutdowns of manufacturing facilities, or further rationing of energy supply within countries where we and/or our customers do business, which could have a material adverse impact on our and our customers' business or results of operations in those countries. \n\nRisks Related to Financial Matters \n\nA decline in operating results or access to financing may have an adverse impact on our liquidity position. \n\nOur ability to make required payments of principal and interest on our debt will depend in part on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, political and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, conditions could arise that could limit our ability to generate sufficient cash flows or to access borrowings to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, which could further limit our financial flexibility or impair our ability to obtain alternative financing sufficient to repay our debt at maturity. We believe that our cash on hand, together with funds generated by our operations and borrowings under our existing credit facilities, will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. Significant assumptions underlie this belief however, including, among other things, assumptions relating to future sales volumes, the successful implementation of our business strategies and that there will be no material adverse developments in our competitive market position, business, liquidity or capital requirements. In the event that we do not have sufficient liquidity, we may be required to seek additional capital, reduce or cut back our operating activities, capital expenditures or otherwise alter our business strategy. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional debt, the agreements governing that debt may contain significant financial and other covenants that may materially restrict our operations. The Company may not be able to obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company has identified certain risks related to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1, Going Concern for further information. \n\nOur indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility. \n\nWe have incurred indebtedness, and may incur additional debt in the future. Our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and operate within restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook. These changes could increase our cost of business, limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage. \n\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition. \n\nDisruption and volatility in global financial markets may lead to increased rates of default and bankruptcy and may negatively impact consumer and business spending levels. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay SIFCO for its products and services may adversely affect its earnings and cash flows. \n\nFurther, we are exposed to fluctuations in inflation, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. The United States and other jurisdictions have recently experienced high levels of inflation. If the inflation rate continues to increase, it will likely affect our expenses, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and labor expenses and increased costs for supplies, and we may not be successful in offsetting such cost increases. \n\nWe cannot predict changes in worldwide or regional economic conditions and government policies, as such conditions are highly volatile and beyond our control. If these conditions deteriorate for extended periods, however, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe funding and costs associated with our pension plans and significant changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates and assumed long-term returns on assets, actual investment returns on our pension plan assets, and legislative and regulatory actions could affect our earnings, equity and contributions to our pension plans in future periods. \n\nCertain of the Company's employees are covered by its noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (&#8220;Plans&#8221;). The impact of these Plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including discount rates, inflation, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. These pension costs are dependent on significant judgment in the use of various estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Differences between actual investment returns and our assumed long-term returns \n\nTable of Contents \n\non assets will result in changes in future pension expense and the funded status of our Plans, and could increase future funding of the Plans. Changes in these factors affect our plan funding, cash flows, earnings, and shareholders&#8217; equity. Additionally, the Company contributed to a multi-employer retirement plan. While the Company withdrew from this plan to mitigate future costs, the Company may be subject to liability in connection with such withdrawal (see Note 8, Retirement Benefit Plans ). \n\nMarket volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and may expose SIFCO to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers. \n\nThe financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers and the financial markets have undergone significant volatility in reaction to various macroeconomic factors. \n\nThe tightening of the credit market and standards, as well as capital market volatility, could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional debt financing on terms equivalent to our existing Credit Agreement. Capital market uncertainty and volatility, together with the Company&#8217;s market capitalization and status as a smaller reporting company, could also negatively impact our ability to obtain capital market financing or bank financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nTightening credit markets could also adversely affect our suppliers' ability to obtain financing. Delays in suppliers' ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing, could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with SIFCO and cause our inability to meet our contract obligations. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental costs and delays. \n\nA write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. \n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets are a component of our assets. At Septem ber 30, 2023, goodwill was $3.5 million and other intangible assets were $0.3 million of our total assets of $96.5 million. We may have to write off all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would be a non-cash charge, it could reduce our earnings and our financial condition. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nOur business is subject to risks associated with widespread public health crises. \n\nWe have continued to see a prolonged residual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, our industry, and our business, with increased challenges for customers, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and increasing inflation, among others. \n\nThe pandemic has affected and is expected to continue to affect certain elements of our operations and business. As a result, we have been operating in industries which continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the residual impacts of the pandemic, we may in the future experience, production site shutdowns, and workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at the facilities operated by our customers and suppliers. Further or a more prolonged suspension of operations or delayed recovery in our operations, and/or any similar suspension of operations or delayed recovery at one or more of our key suppliers, or the failure of any of our key suppliers, would result in further challenges to our business, leading to a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\nWe expect to continue to experience unpredictable changes in demand from the markets we serve. The A&#38;E industries continue to be negatively impacted by the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects as a result of various restrictions on air travel, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. These factors have caused reductions in demand for commercial aircraft, which have adversely impacted our net sales and operating results and may continue to do so for an extended period of time. Further, an overall reduction in business activity as a result of the disruption previously led to a softening of the energy market. If the residual impact of the pandemic continues and/or conditions worsen, we may experience additional adverse impacts on our operations, costs, customer orders, and collections of accounts receivable, which may be material. While we are unable to predict the magnitude of the impact of these factors at this time, the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\nAdditionally, the residual impacts of the pandemic could lead to an extended disruption of economic activity whereby the impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be material. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the residual impacts of the coronavirus outbreak may be difficult to assess or predict, the resurgence of a widespread pandemic could result in significant or sustained disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. While the Company believes it \n\nTable of Contents \n\nhas adequate cash/liquidity available to finance its operations, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors (including the continued residual impact of COVID-19) beyond our control. In addition, while we believe we have taken appropriate steps to maintain a safe workplace to protect our employees from contracting and spreading the coronavirus, we may not be able to prevent the spread of the virus among our employees, face litigation or other proceedings making claims related to unsafe working conditions, inadequate protection of our employees or other claims. Any of these claims, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation or divert management's attention and resources. Furthermore, we may face a sustained disruption to our operations due to one or more of the factors described above. \n\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. \n\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. \n\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares or at all. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, which include: \n\na. our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors or our significant customers; \n\nb. the public&#8217;s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; \n\nc. changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track the stocks of our competitors; \n\nd. new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business; \n\ne. changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; \n\nf. changes in general conditions in the domestic and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, health crises or responses to such events; \n\ng. litigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors; \n\nh. strategic action by our competitors; \n\ni. sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders; and \n\nj. our stock being closely held by insider holdings and is thinly traded which impacts price volatility. \n\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company&#8217;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If litigation is instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources. \n\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow. \n\nSIFCO is subject to income taxes in the United States, Italy and Ireland. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income, the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense, profitability and cash flow. \n\nDamage or destruction of our facilities caused by storms, earthquakes or other causes could adversely affect our financial results and financial condition. \n\nWe have operations located in regions of the world that may be exposed to damaging storms, earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as other events outside of our control, such as fires, floods and other catastrophic events. We maintain standard property casualty insurance coverage for our properties and may be able to recover costs associated with certain natural disasters through insurance; however, even if covered by insurance, any significant damage or destruction of our facilities due to such events could result in our inability to meet customer delivery schedules and may result in the loss of customers and \n\nTable of Contents \n\nsignificant additional costs to SIFCO. Thus, any significant damage or destruction of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n\nThe occurrence of litigation where we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable. \n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal and other proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. While we believe no current proceedings, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, no assurances can be given. Any such claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \n\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws, and complying with those laws may cause us to incur significant costs. \n\nOur operations and facilities are subject to numerous stringent environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in compliance with these laws and regulations, future changes in these laws, regulations or interpretations of them, or changes in the nature of our operations may require us to make significant capital expenditures to ensure compliance. \n\n", "item_7": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nSIFCO is engaged in the production of forgings and machined and sub-assembled components primarily for the Aerospace and Defense, Energy and Commercial Space markets. The processes and services include forging, heat-treating, chemical processing and machining. The Company operates under one business segment. \n\nWhen planning and evaluating its business operations, the Company takes into consideration certain factors, including the following: (i) the projected build rate for commercial, business and military aircraft, as well as the engines that power such aircraft; (ii) the projected build rate for industrial steam and gas turbine engines; and (iii) the projected maintenance, repair and overhaul schedules for commercial, business and military aircraft, as well as the engines that power such aircraft. \n\nThe Company operates within a cost structure that includes a significant fixed component. Therefore, higher net sales volumes are expected to result in greater operating income because such higher volumes allow the business operations to better leverage the fixed component of their respective cost structures. Conversely, the opposite effect is expected to occur at lower net sales and related production volumes. \n\nA. Results of Operations \n\nOverview \n\nThe Company produces forged components for (i) turbine engines that power commercial, business and regional aircraft as well as military aircraft and armored military vehicles; (ii) airframe applications for a variety of aircraft; (iii) industrial gas and steam turbine engines for power generation units; and (iv) other commercial applications. \n\nCybersecurity Incident \n\nAs reported on Forms 8-K filed January 6, 2023 and February 10, 2023, the Company became aware of unauthorized access to the Company's systems on December 30, 2022. The Company&#8217;s domestic operations were impacted by this Cybersecurity Incident which resulted in production delays and delayed shipments due to information access limitations. The Company initiated response protocols and an investigation, engaging cyber security experts to assist with the assessment of the incident and to help determine what data was impacted. The Company has since completed data recovery and restoration from the cyber incident. See Note 11 , Commitments and Contingencies. \n\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022 \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet sales comparative information for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, is as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in millions) Years Ended September 30, Year Over Year Increase \n\n(Decrease) \n\nNet Sales 2023 2022 Aerospace components for: Fixed wing aircraft $ 40.1 $ 39.5 $ 0.6 Rotorcraft 16.4 15.6 0.8 Energy components for power generation units 23.0 17.4 5.6 Commercial product and other revenue 7.5 11.4 (3.9) Total $ 87.0 $ 83.9 $ 3.1 ##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales in fiscal 2023 increased 3.7%, or $3.1 million to $87.0 million, compar ed with $83.9 million in fiscal 2022. The timing of shipments, coupled with increased demand in the steam turbine power generation market, have contributed to the increase in deliveries in fiscal 2023 than in fiscal 2022. Fixed wing aircraft sales increased $0.6 million compared with the same period last year primarily due to F35, 737 and 787 programs. Rotorcraft sales increased $0.8 million in fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022 primarily due to commercial and Blackhawk programs. The energy components for power generation un its increased $5.6 million compared with the same period last year due to growth in the steam turbine markets. Commercial products and other revenue decreased $3.9 million in fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, primarily due to timing of orders related to a munitions program partially offset by an increase in commercial space. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCommercial net sales wer e 55.6% of total net sales and military net sales wer e 44.4% of to tal net sales in fiscal 2023, compared with 47.4% and 52.6%, respectively, in the comparable period in fiscal 2022. Commercial net sales increased $8.6 million to $48.4 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $39.8 million in fiscal 2022 primarily due to growth in the energy components for power generation units (steam turbine markets) and the increase in build rates in the commercial aerospace industry. Military net sales decreased $5.4 million to $38.7 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $44.1 million in fiscal 2022 primarily due to V22 demand reduction and timing of orders related to a munition progra m. \n\nCost of Goods Sold \n\nCost of goods sol d (\"COGS\") decreased by $6.3 million, or 7.3%, to $79.5 million, or 91.3% of net sales, during fiscal 2023, compared with $85.8 million or 102.2% of net sales in the comparable period of fisc al 2022. The decrease was primarily due to increased volume, ERC benefit of $1.5 million and reduction of net realizable value (\"NRV\") reserve of $0.9 million and lower idle expense of $0.9 million . Current year results include $2.1 million of idle expense and $0.9 million benefit associated with NRV compared with prior year costs of $3.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively. \n\nGross Profit (Loss) \n\nGross profit increased by $9.4 million, to $7.5 million during fiscal 2023, compared with a loss of $1.9 million in fiscal 2022. Gross margin percent of sales was 8.7% during fiscal 2023, compared with (2.2%) in fiscal 2022, primarily due to increased volume, ERC benefit of $1.5 million, reduction of NRV reserve and idle expense, and lower outside processing costs compared with the prior year. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $14.0 million, or 16.1% of net sales, during fiscal 2023, compared with $11.9 million, or 14.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2022. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to incremental IT costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $1.3 million and professional fees primarily related to the ERC credit of $0.4 million partially offset by ERC benefit of $0.2 million. See Note 11 , Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on cyber incident. \n\nAmortization of Intangibles \n\nAmortization of in tangibles decreased $0.1 million to $0.2 million during fiscal 2023, compared with $0.3 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized during fiscal 2023. \n\nOther/General \n\nThe Company recorded an operat ing loss of $6.7 million during fiscal 2023, compared with an operating loss of $14.1 million in fiscal 2022. \n\nPrior year results included a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the PPP loan, that was forgiven by the SBA, for $5.1 million. See Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event for further discussion. \n\nNet interest expe nse was $1.3 million in fisca l 2023 compared with $0.6 million in fisca l 2022. The increase was due to higher interest rates and higher average borrowings compared with the prior year. See Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event for further discussion. \n\nThe following table sets forth the weighted average interest rates and weighted average outstanding balances under the Company&#8217;s debt agreements in fiscal 2023 and 2022: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Weighted Average Interest Rate Years Ended September 30, Weighted Average Outstanding Balance Years Ended September 30, &#160; 2023 2022 2023 2022 Revolving credit agreement 6.9% 2.6% $ 13.1 million $ 10.4 million Foreign term debt 4.6% 2.8% $ 7.1 million $ 6.2 million Other debt 1.5% 0.7% $ 0.5 million $ 1.9 million ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company believes that inflation did not materially impact its results of operations in either fiscal 2023 or 2022. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 was (1.9%) compared with 0.4% in fiscal 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to changes in jurisdictional mix of income in fiscal 2023 compared with the same period in fiscal 2022. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the valuation allowance against the Company&#8217;s U.S. deferred tax assets and income in foreign jurisdictions that are taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory tax rate. \n\nNet Loss \n\nNet loss wa s $8.7 million during fiscal 2023, compared with $9.6 million in fisca l 2022. The decrease in net loss in the current period was primarily due to increased volume, ERC refund benefit, reduction of NRV reserve and idle expense, lower outside processing costs and stabilized raw material pricing partially offset by cybersecurity incident costs. Prior year results included a $5.1 million gain on debt extinguishment previously noted. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nPresented below is certain financial information based on the Company's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. References to &#8220;EBITDA&#8221; mean earnings (losses) from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and references to &#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221; mean EBITDA plus, as applicable for each relevant period, certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. \n\nNeither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). The Company presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity, including the Company&#8217;s ability to incur and service debt and it uses EBITDA to evaluate prospective acquisitions. Although the Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the reasons noted above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations. Therefore, reviewers of the Company&#8217;s financial information should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results of operations as reported in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include: \n\n&#8226; Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on indebtedness; \n\n&#8226; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects any cash requirements for such replacements; \n\n&#8226; The omission of the amortization expense associated with the Company&#8217;s intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA; and \n\n&#8226; Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of operations. \n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to the Company to invest in the growth of its businesses. Management compensates for these limitations by not viewing EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and specifically by using other GAAP measures, such as net income (loss), net sales, and operating income (loss), to measure operating performance. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and neither should be considered as an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company&#8217;s calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: \n\n##TABLE_START (Dollars in thousands) Years Ended September 30, &#160; 2023 2022 Net loss $ (8,692) $ (9,640) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization expense 6,404 6,348 Interest expense, net 1,348 646 Income tax expense (benefit) 159 (43) EBITDA (781) (2,689) Adjustments: Foreign currency exchange loss, net (1) 9 15 Other loss (income), net (2) 275 (149) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets (3) 1 (7) Gain on debt extinguishment (4) &#8212; (5,106) Equity compensation expense (5) 375 428 Pension settlement/curtailment benefit (6) 108 208 LIFO impact (7) (305) 729 IT incident costs, net (8) 1,275 &#8212; Strategic alternative expense (9) 86 &#8212; Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,043 $ (6,571) ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Represents the gain or loss from changes in the exchange rates between the functional currency and the foreign currency in which the transaction is denominated. \n\n(2) Represents miscellaneous non-operating income or expense, such as pension costs or grant income. \n\n(3) Represents the difference between the proceeds from the sale of operating equipment and the carrying value shown on the Company's books. \n\n(4) Represents the gain on extinguishment of debt and interest for the amount forgiven by the SBA as it relates to the PPP loan in fiscal 2022. \n\n(5) Represents the equity-based compensation expense recognized by the Company under the 2016 Plan due to granting of awards, awards not vesting and/or forfeitures. \n\n(6) Represents expense incurred by its defined benefit pension plans related to settlement of pension obligations. \n\n(7) Represents the change in the reserve for inventories for which cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;) method. \n\n(8) Represents incremental information technology costs as it relates to the cybersecurity incident and loss on insurance recovery. \n\n(9) Represents expense related to evaluation of strategic alternatives. \n\nReference to the above activities can be found in the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\nHistorically, the main sources of liquidity of the Company have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below under \"Financing Activities\"). The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected if the Company is unable to restructure existing debt obligations, obtain capital or enter into a strategic alternative transaction which provides sufficient funding for the refinancing of its outstanding indebtedness prior to the maturity date of its obligations under the Credit Agreements, by customers extending payment terms to the Company and/or the decrease in demand for our products. The Company and management will continue to assess and actively manage liquidity needs. See Note 5 , Debt and Subsequent Event . \n\nTable of Contents \n\nCash and cash equivale nts decreased to $0.4 million at Septemb er 30, 2023 compared with $1.2 million at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, cash included financing proceeds for capital investment and a nominal amount of the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents were in the possession of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Distributions from the Company&#8217;s non-U.S. subsidiaries to the Company may be subject to adverse tax consequences. \n\nOperating Activities \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operating activi ties used $1.4 million of cash in f iscal 2023, compared with $0.3 million provided in fiscal 2022. The cash used by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to net operating loss of $8.7 million, adjusted for non-cash items such as change in NRV reserve $1.1 million, and LIFO benefit of $0.3 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization of $6.4 million, equity based compensation of $0.3 million and sources of working capital of $1.7 million. The source of cash from working capital of $1.7 million was primarily due to increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments and lower inventories due to extended lead times, partially offset by higher accounts receivable due to increased sales at the end of the fiscal year. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operating activi ties provided $0.3 million of cash in f iscal 2022. The cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $6.3 million, inventory write down to NRV of $1.5 million, LIFO effect of $0.7 million, equity based compensation of $0.3 million and source of working capital of $6.0 million, partially offset by the forgiveness of the PPP loan of $5.1 million and net loss of $9.6 million. The source of cash from working capital of $6.0 million was primarily due to reductions in receivables due to lower sales and improved collections as well as decreases in inventories, partially offset by payments to suppliers. \n\nInvesting Activities \n\nCash used for investing activities was $2.4 million in fiscal 2023, compared with $3.2 million in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 expenditures were used primarily for manufacturing enhancement and maintenance capital. Capital commitments at September 30, 2023 were $1.1 million. The Company anticipates the total fiscal 2024 capital expenditures will be within the range of $3.5 million to $4.5 million and will relate principally to the further enhancement of production and product offering capabilities and operating cost reductions. \n\nFinancing Activities \n\nCash provided by financing activities was $2.9 million in fiscal 2023 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.7 million in fiscal 2022. \n\nAs discussed in Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event , the Company amended the Credit Agreement and the Export Agreement on August 9, 2023. The combined maximum borrowings decreased to $30.0 million from $35.0 million. The Seventh Amendment (the \"Seventh Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\") consists of a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing of $23.0 million, previously $28.0 million. The revolving commitment through the Third Amendment (the \"Third Amendment\") of the Export Credit Agreement, which lends amounts to the Company on foreign receivables remained unchanged at $7.0 million. The Seventh Amendment, among other things, (i) advanced the loan maturity date to December 31, 2023; (ii) provided a waiver of Existing Defaults and concludes the forbearance period as described under the Forbearance Agreement dated April 28, 2023; (iv) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Exposure under the ABL Credit Agreement and Export Revolving Loan may not at any time exceed the lesser of Revolving Commitment, less the Availability Block, if applicable, the Borrowing Base, and in combination with the Export Revolving Loan under the Export Credit Agreement to $18.0 million through September 30, 2023 and $19.0 million thereafter; (v) the Reserves under the Borrowing Base in the ABL Credit Agreement were reduced to $1.5 million through September 30, 2023 and $2.0 million thereafter. The Third Amendment amends the Export Credit Agreement to (i) modified the loan maturity date to December 31, 2023 and (ii) provided waiver of Existing Defaults and concludes the forbearance period as described under the Forbearance Agreement dated April 28, 2023. The Seventh Amendment was subject to satisfaction of certain post closing deliverables, including: (i) one or more proposed term sheets which provide for the refinancing of all of the Obligations under the current Credit Agreement, in each case in an amount sufficient to repay the Obligations in full, by no later than September 19, 2023; (ii) a Confidential Information Memorandum (\"CIM\"), by no later than September 20, 2023; and (iii) a duly executed term sheet providing for the refinancing of all of the Obligations in an amount sufficient to repay the Obligations in full, by no later than October 8, 2023. All post closing deliverables were satisfied as required under the Seventh Amendment. \n\nAs discussed in Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event , on November 8, 2023, the Company entered into the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the \"Eighth Amendment\") with its Lender. The Eighth Amendment, among other things, reduced the Reserves under the Borrowing Base in the Credit Agreement to $1.5 million, or such lesser amount, if any, as may be agreed upon in writing by the Lender in its sole discretion. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAs discussed in Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event , on December 21, 2023 the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment (the \"Ninth Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement and the Fourth Amendment (the \"Fourth Amendment\") to the Export Credit Agreement with its lender JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the \"Lender\") The Ninth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to, among other things, to: (i) reflect the incurrence by borrowers of the Subordinated Loan and the execution and delivery by borrowers, the Lender and GHI of the Subordinated Loan Documents, and the receipt by borrowers of $3.0 million immediately available funds on the Ninth Amendment Effective Date; (ii) delay the maturity date from December 31, 2023 to October 4, 2024, or any earlier date on which the Revolving Commitment is reduced to zero or otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement; (iii) reduce the Revolving Commitment from $23.0 million to $19.0 million; (iv) modify the Reserves of $1.5 million, increasing on the first day of each month by $0.3 million, commencing on May 1, 2024 and continuing until (and including) August 1, 2024, or such lesser amount, if any, as may be agreed upon in writing by the Lender in its sole discretion (which may be by email from the Lender), plus (d) the PP&#38;E Component; (v) modify the Applicable Margin schedule to reflect the following applicable rates 2.75% (SOFR Spread), and 0.50% (Commitment Fee Rate). The Fourth Amendment of the Export Credit Agreement, to, among other things, to: (i) reflect the incurrence by borrowers of the Subordinated Loan and the execution and delivery by borrowers, the Lender and GHI of the Subordinated Loan Documents, and the receipt by borrowers of $3.0 million in immediately available funds on the Ninth Amendment Effective Date; and (ii) delay the maturity date to October 4, 2024, or any earlier date on which the Revolving Commitment is reduced to zero or otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms thereof. \n\nThe Company incurred a secured subordinated loan from Garnet Holdings, Inc., a California corporation owned and controlled by Mark J. Silk (&#8220;GHI&#8221;) (Mr. Silk is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and considered a related party), in the original principal amount of $3.0 million (the &#8220;Subordinated Loan&#8221;) as a condition to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Ninth Amendment to the Credit Agreement. See Note 13 , Related Party Transactions and Note 14 , Subsequent Event for further discussion. \n\nAs discussed in Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event , the Company's Maniago, Italy location did not obtain any new borrowings in fiscal 2023. The Company repaid $2.0 million of its Company's foreign term loans in 2023. \n\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company's Maniago, Italy location obtained borrowings from two separate lenders. The first loan was for $1.2 million with repayment terms of six years. A second loan with a five year term was obtained in the amount of $1.0 million. The proceeds of the first loan is to be used for working capital purposes, the proceeds of the second loan are earmarked for capital investment. The Company repaid $1.2 million of its Company's foreign term loans in 2022. \n\nThe Company had net borrowings under its revolving credit facility of $5.1 million in fiscal 2023 and $2.2 million in fiscal 2022. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of 66.67% of the stock of its first-tier non-U.S. subsidiaries. Borrowings will bear interest at the lender's established domestic rate or SOFR, plus the applicable margin as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The revolver has a rate based on SOFR plus a 2.25% spread, which was 7.68% at September 30, 2023 and the Export Credit Agreement, as discussed in Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event, has a rate based on SOFR plus a 1.75% spread, which was 7.18% at September 30, 2023. The Company also has a commitment fee of 0.25% under the Credit Agreement to be incurred on the unused balance of the revolver. \n\nAs the Company&#8217;s Credit Agreement is asset-based, a sustained significant decrease in revenue in the U.S. or excessive aging of the underlying receivables could materially affect the collateral capacity limitation of the availability under the Credit Agreement and could impact our ability to comply with covenants in our Credit Agreement. \n\nUnder the Company's Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to certain customary loan covenants regarding availability as discussed in Note 5, Debt and Subsequent Event . The availability at September 30, 2023 was $2.8 million. If the availability had fallen short, the Company would be required to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio (\"FCCR\") covenant, which must not be less than 1.1 to 1.0. In the event of a default, we may not be able to access our revolver, which could impact the ability to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and invest in new business opportunities. Because the availability was greater than the $1.5 million Reserve minimum as of September 30, 2023, the FCCR calculation was not required. \n\nFuture cash flows from the Company&#8217;s operations may be used to pay down amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and its foreign related debts. The Company believes it has adequate cash/liquidity available to finance its operations from the combination of (i) the Company&#8217;s expected cash flows from operations and (ii) funds available under the Credit Agreement for its domestic locations. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nAdditionally, the credit and capital markets saw significant volatility during the course of the pandemic. Tightening of the credit market and standards, as well as capital market volatility, could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional debt financing on terms equivalent to our existing Credit Agreement. Capital market uncertainty and volatility, together with the Company&#8217;s market capitalization and status as a smaller reporting company, could also negatively impact our ability to obtain equity financing. \n\nC. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company may be party to certain arrangements that are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company does not have obligations that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. \n\nD. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates are revised as additional information becomes available. The Company believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from the management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nSignificant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The Company believes that the assumptions and estimates associated with allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, goodwill, contract balances, and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgements, and include areas where different estimates reasonably could materially impact the financial statements. The Company believes that the critical accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. \n\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts \n\nThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments. The Company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers&#8217; credit-worthiness, current economic trends or market conditions, past collection history, aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks. As these factors change, the Company&#8217;s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods. Historically, losses have been within management&#8217;s expectations and have not been significant. \n\nInventories \n\nApproximately 19% of the Company's inventory is valued using the last-in, first-out (&#8220;LIFO&#8221;) method with the remaining valued using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion. \n\nThe Company evaluates obsolete and excess inventory on a quarterly basis. The Company maintains a formal policy, which requires at a minimum, that amounts are written down based on an analysis of the age of the inventory. In addition, if the Company learns of specific obsolescence, other than that identified by the aging criteria, an additional write down will be recognized. Specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change or based on cancellation of an order. Management&#8217;s judgment is necessary in determining the proper write down for obsolete and excess inventory. For the portion of the Company's inventory not valued at LIFO, inventory is valued at FIFO and stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company evaluates net realizable value on a quarterly basis. See Note 2, Inventories for further discussion. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the five-step revenue recognition model in which it depicts the transfer of goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revenue standard also requires disclosure sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from the cost to obtain or fulfill a contract. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nContract Balances \n\nContract assets on the consolidated balance sheets are recognized when a good is transferred to the customer and the Company does not have the contractual right to bill for the related performance obligations. In these instances, revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer and the right to payment is not solely subject to the passage of time. Amounts do not exceed their net realizable value. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. Payment from customers are received based on the terms established in the contract with the customer. \n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset (group) might not be recoverable. This review involves judgment and is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, which include proceeds from disposal of assets and which the Company considers a critical accounting estimate. The Company would assess the fair value of the asset group and compare it to its carrying value. Under the Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 360 (\"Topic 360\"), if the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then the long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. \n\nIn projecting future undiscounted cash flows, the Company relies on internal budgets and forecasts, and projected proceeds upon disposal of long-lived assets. The Company&#8217;s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions, such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition. The Company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable; however, changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the Company&#8217;s estimates, which could result in future impairment charges. \n\n2023 Long-Lived Asset Recoverability Tests \n\nIn the first, second, third and fourth quarters, the Company evaluated triggering events and did not identify any indicators that the asset groups might be impaired. \n\n2022 Long-Lived Asset Recoverability Tests \n\nIn the third and fourth quarters, certain qualitative factors, including operating results, at the Orange, California (\"Orange\") location, triggered recoverability tests. The results of both indicated that the long-lived assets, right-of-use assets and definite lived intangible assets were recoverable and did not require further review for impairment. \n\nImpairment of Goodwill \n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually as of July 31. If circumstances change during interim periods between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company will test goodwill for impairment. Factors that would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment include a sustained decline in the Company's stock price, prolonged negative industry or economic trends, or significant under-performance relative to expected, historical or projected future operating results. Management uses judgment to determine whether to use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative fair value measurement for its goodwill impairment testing. The Company's fair value measurement approach combines the income and market valuation techniques for each of the Company&#8217;s reporting units that carry goodwill. These valuation techniques use estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the determination of appropriate market comparables, projected future cash flows (including timing and profitability), discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rate, and projected future economic and market conditions. \n\nIf a reporting unit fails the quantitative impairment test, impairment expense is immediately recorded as the difference between the reporting unit's fair value and carrying value not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded. \n\n2023 Annual Goodwill Impairment Tests \n\nSIFCO performed its annual test as of July 31, 2023. Goodwill existed at one of the Company's reporting units, Cleveland, Ohio as of July 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. No impairment charge was identified in connection with the annual goodwill impairment test with respect to the Cleveland reporting unit. Refer to Note 3, Goodwill and Intangible Assets . \n\n2022 Annual Goodwill Impairment Tests \n\nSIFCO performed its annual test as of July 31, 2022. Goodwill existed at one of the Company's reporting units, Cleveland, Ohio as of July 31, 2022 and September 30, 2022. No impairment charge was identified in connection with the annual goodwill impairment test with respect to the Cleveland reporting unit. Refer to Note 3, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Expense \n\nThe Company maintains four defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;). The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under these four defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing various assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to change in the assumed discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets for the Company's pension plans as of September 30, 2023. \n\n##TABLE_START Impact on Fiscal 2023 Benefits Expense Impact on September 30, 2023 Projected Benefit Obligation for Pension Plans Change in Assumptions (In thousands) 25 basis point decrease in discount rate $ 17 $ 403 25 basis point increase in discount rate $ (17) $ (403) 100 basis point decrease in expected long-term rate of return on assets $ 181 $ &#8212; 100 basis point increase in expected long-term rate of return on assets $ (181) $ &#8212; ##TABLE_END\n\nThe discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions/elements associated with these defined benefit pension plans. \n\nThe Company determines the expected return on plan assets principally based on (i) the expected return for the various asset classes in the respective plans&#8217; investment portfolios and (ii) the targeted allocation of the respective plans&#8217; assets. The expected return on plan assets is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current and anticipated market conditions such as inflation, interest rates and market performance. Should the actual rate of return differ materially from the assumed/expected rate, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of its plans and, accordingly, on its related future net pension expense. \n\nThe discount rate for each plan is determined, as of the fiscal year end measurement date, using prevailing market spot-rates (from an appropriate yield curve) with maturities corresponding to the expected timing/date of the future defined benefit payment amounts for each of the respective plans. Such corresponding spot-rates are used to discount future years&#8217; projected defined benefit payment amounts back to the fiscal year end measurement date as a present value. A composite discount rate is then developed for each plan by determining the single rate of discount that will produce the same present value as that obtained by applying the annual spot-rates. The discount rate may be further revised if the market environment indicates that the above methodology generates a discount rate that does not accurately reflect the prevailing interest rates as of the fiscal year end measurement date. The Company computes a weighted-average discount rate taking into account anticipated plan payments and the associated interest rates from the USI Consulting Group Pension Discount Curve. \n\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, SIFCO used the following weighted-average assumptions: \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended September 30, &#160; 2023 2022 Discount rate for liabilities 5.6 % 5.2 % Discount rate for expenses 5.1 % 2.9 % Expected return on assets 6.2 % 6.4 % ##TABLE_END\n\nDeferred Tax Valuation Allowance \n\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with the provisions of the Accounting Standards Codification guidance related to accounting for income taxes, whereby the Company recognizes an income tax benefit related to income tax credits, loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis. \n\nA high degree of judgment is required to determine the extent a valuation allowance should be provided against deferred tax assets. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets considering all available evidence, both positive and negative. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. It is generally \n\nTable of Contents \n\ndifficult to outweigh objectively verifiable negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Based on the weight of available evidence, the Company determines if it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized in the future. \n\nAs a result of losses incurred in recent years, the Company entered into a three-year cumulative loss position in the U.S. jurisdiction during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and remains in a cumulative loss position at the conclusion of fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the Company maintained its valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe calculation of the Company's tax liabilities also involves considering uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. SIFCO recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on its estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes will be required, and it reports related interest and penalties as income taxes. Refer to Note 7, Income Taxes for further discussion. \n\nE. Impact of Newly Issued Accounting Standards \n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" and subsequent updates. ASU 2016-13 changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The new guidance will replace the current incurred loss approach with an expected loss model. The new expected credit loss impairment model will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt instruments, net investments in leases, loan commitments and standby letters of credit. Upon initial recognition of the exposure, the expected credit loss model requires entities to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. Financial instruments with similar risk characteristics should be grouped together when estimating expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 does not prescribe a specific method to make the estimate, so its application will require significant judgment. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. However, in November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Loss (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842),\" which defers the effective date for public filers that qualify as a smaller reporting company (\"SRC\"), as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to fiscal years after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Because SIFCO is considered a SRC, this ASU is effective for the Company beginning October 1, 2023. The effect of adopting this ASU is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's results within the consolidated statements of operations and financial condition. \n\nIn July 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, &#8220; Presentation of Financial Statement (Topic 205), Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), and Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) &#8221;, to amend various SEC paragraphs in the Accounting Standards Codification to reflect the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120, among other things. The ASU does not provide any new guidance so there is no transition or effective date associated with it. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2023-03 on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \" Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" , that would enhance disclosures for significant segment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. ASC 280 requires a public entity to report for each reportable segment a measure of segment profit or loss that its chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) uses to assess segment performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more useful financial analyses. Currently, Topic 280 requires that a public entity disclose certain information about its reportable segments. For example, a public entity is required to report a measure of segment profit or loss that the CODM uses to assess segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources. ASC 280 also requires other specified segment items and amounts such as depreciation, amortization and depletion expense to be disclosed under certain circumstances. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 do not change or remove those disclosure requirements. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 also do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in ASU 2023-07 retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nTable of Contents \n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \" Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" . ASU 2023-09 is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in ASU 2023-09 prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. \n\nTable of Contents \n\n", "item_7a": ""}
