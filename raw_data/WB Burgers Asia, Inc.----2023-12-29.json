Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of the financial statements with a narrative report on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited Financial Statements and notes thereto for the year ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, included under Item 8 &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; in this Report. The following discussion contains forwa rd-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of this Report regarding forward-looking statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nSummary of Business \n\n&#160; \n\nWB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., referred to herein as &#8220;WBJ&#8221;, which we operate through and share the same business plan of, holds the rights to the &#8220;Master Franchise Agreement&#8221; with Jakes&#8217; Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company, as it pertains to the establishment and operation of Wayback Burger Restaurants within the country of Japan. \n\n&#160; \n\nMaster Franchise Agreement - Summary \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Master Franchise Agreement provides WBJ the right to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the country of Japan, and also license affiliated and unaffiliated third parties (&#8220;Franchisees&#8221;) to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Country of Japan, this agreement lasts for a term of twenty years, unless it is terminated sooner in accordance with terms outlined in the Master Franchise Agreement, and may be extended one additional, consecutive term of ten years. In exchange for such rights, we paid Jake&#8217;s Franchising $2,700,000 USD, and we must pay an additional $10,000 for each additional company operated Wayback Burgers restaurant and for each sub-franchised location the fee is either $10,000 or 28.57% of the initial franchise fee collected for such Restaurant, whichever is greater. Additionally, there is also a royalty fee in the amount of three percent (3%) of the Gross Sales of all Company-Operated Wayback Burgers Restaurants in the Country and the greater of two percent (2%) of the Gross Sales of all Franchised Wayback Burgers Restaurants in the Country or forty percent (40%) of the royalty fees collected for all Franchised Wayback Burgers Restaurants in the Country. The Master Franchise Agreement, amongst other things, also provides WBJ the right of first refusal to enter into a subsequent Master Franchise Agreement with Jake&#8217;s Franchising, LLC to establish and operate Wayback Burgers restaurants in the Countries of Indonesia, Malaysia (Eastern Malaysia only, Western Malaysia if it becomes available as it is currently licensed to another party), the Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan. \n\n&#160; \n\nMaster Franchise Agreement - Duties \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Master Franchise Agreement dictates specific duties we must perform which include, but are not limited to, providing Jake&#8217;s Franchising with plans and specifications for restaurant locations, provide employees with Wayback Burgers mandated training, present Jake&#8217;s Franchising with copies of all potential advertising and promotional material, etc. Furthermore, we are required to open one Wayback Burgers restaurant by the end of the 2022 calendar year, three restaurants by the end of the 2023 calendar year, and an additional three restaurants must open, and remain in operation, every following year until December 31, 2041, at which time we must have sixty Wayback Burgers restaurants open and in operation. If we fail to meet these targets, then we would need to renegotiate terms with Jake&#8217;s Franchising, or we could potentially lose our master franchise rights in their entirety. As of the date of this report, the Company has not adhered to the stipulated requirements outlined in the Master Franchise Agreement concerning the establishment of additional restaurant locations. While the Company has received informal assurance, through verbal discussions with representatives of Jake&#8217;s Franchising, that no penalties will be imposed, there remains the potential for Jake&#8217;s Franchising to exercise their discretion and terminate the Master Franchise Agreement unless the Company achieves full compliance with all specified terms. In the event of such termination, the Company&#8217;s operational outcomes would be adversely affected, necessitating a significant alteration of our business plan, or potentially raising questions about the feasibility of sustaining our operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor full terms and details of the Master Franchise Agreement, one can view a complete copy which has been filed as an exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2021. \n\n&#160; \n\nWB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd. seeks to make &#8220;Wayback Burgers&#8221; a nationally recognized brand, if not a household name, within the country of Japan through the promotion and opening of various Wayback Burgers Restaurants. \n\n&#160; \n\nLocations \n\n&#160; \n\nOn November 9, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., consummated a lease agreement with Arai Co., Ltd., a Japanese realty group, for the location of our first Wayback Burgers restaurant. The property is located in the popular shopping plaza of Omotesando, located in the Tokyo prefecture. Currently, this is our central and only physical location. We believe the high volume of foot traffic and shopping will yield a large group of patrons seeking to try our product offerings. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn August of 2022, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., entered into and consummated a rental agreement with &#8220;Kitchen Depot&#8221; for a ghost kitchen in the Tamachi neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. Following notice provided to Kitchen Depot in September of 2023, in November of 2023, the Company terminated its rental agreement with Kitchen Depot, as well as its operations at its ghost kitchen in the Tamachi neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. The Company has no plans to resume operations at this location at any juncture, as it believes this location is unlikely to be profitable, considering the low volume of orders it received while this location was operational. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn October 1, 2023, an agreement was established between our company and Next Meats Co., Ltd., spanning a three-year duration, concerning the licensing of logos and related assets. Subsequently, in November 2023, the operation of a ghost kitchen named &#34;NEXT Restaurant&#34; commenced at our flagship Omotesando location. This initiative stems from a collaboration between our company and Next Meats Holdings, Inc., particularly its subsidiary Next Meats Co., Ltd., aimed at opening a venue offering Next Meats menu selections, including the prominently featured &#34;NEXT Pizza&#34;. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe majority of menu items available at this ghost kitchen are sourced from Mama Foods Co., Ltd., the primary manufacturer of products for Next Meats Holdings, Inc. Consequently, 1% of the sales generated at this restaurant location are remitted to Next Meats Co., Ltd., as part of the collaborative agreement. \n\n&#160; \n\nSubsidiaries \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have two wholly owned subsidiaries, WB Burgers Japan Co., Ltd., and Store Foods Co., Ltd. Both of our wholly owned subsidiaries are Japanese Companies. Store Foods Co., Ltd. has not yet commenced any material operations and our plans for Store Foods Co., Ltd. have not yet been fully determined with any level of specificity. \n\n&#160; \n\nAnticipated Capital Requirements \n\n&#160; \n\nIn order to fund our operations for the next twelve months we believe we will need a minimum of at least $500,000. We believe this will cover our future expansion and growth efforts, barring any unforeseen capital expenditures that may arise. \n\n&#160; \n\n- 14 - \n\n&#160; \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of July 31, 2023, and 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $161,213 and $126,669, respectively. The variance in our cash balance from July 31, 2022 to July 31, 2023 is the result of the Company having increased operations, namely our dine in and dine out restaurant location in the Omotesando Shopping Plaza, located in Tokyo, Japan. \n\n&#160; \n\nAssets \n\n&#160; \n\nOur total assets for July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022 were $1,259,223 and $3,760,615, respectively. The reason for the variance is primarily attributable to the fact that the Master Franchise Agreement we entered into with Jakes&#8217; Franchising LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company, to operate Wayback Burgers&#8217; Franchise locations, is recorded as an asset for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, but not for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe reason why the franchise rights were not recorded as an asset for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 is because the Company has demonstrated no track record of capitalizing on the franchise rights beyond the company owned stores which were not profitable through the current date. \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, and 2022, we generated revenues of $581,798 and $180,821 respectively. The variance in revenue year over year is due to the fact that we increased our operations during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. However, our cost of revenue was $1,341,572 for the year ended July 31, 2023 and $716,083 for the year ended July 31, 2022. As a result, our gross loss for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 was $759,774 compared to a gross loss of $535,262 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. We do not believe that our cost of revenues will proportionally increase with our revenues, and thus, we believe generating more revenue will h elp to alleviate our losses we have experienced for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and July 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Income (Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income (expense) was $148,105, comprised of cash receipts of the consumption tax, for the year ended July 31, 2023, and $(334,317) for the year ended July 31, 2022. The variance year over year is primarily attributable to expensed related party loan receivables from the year ended July 31, 2022 that was recorded as &#8220;other expense&#8221;. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Operating Loss \n\n&#160; \n\nOur general and administrative expenses were $3,311,706 for the year ended July 31, 2023 and $733,744 for the year ended July 31, 2022. Our net operating loss for the year ended July 31, 2023 was $4,071,480 and $1,269,006 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The variance is a result of the to tal general and administrative expense for the year ended July 31, 2023, which includes a loss on impairment totaling $1,899,666. This impairment loss is related to the Company&#8217;s adjustment to the value of the franchise rights asset. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs mentioned above, we believe that in order to remedy our net loss we will require additional revenue. We are currently exploring a means in which to gain more customers at our dine in location. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditional Paid-In Capital \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the period ended July 31, 2022, White Knight forgave a loan to the Company of approximately $2,317,272, which is recorded as additional paid-in capital. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s sole officer and director, Koichi Ishizuka, paid expenses on behalf of the Company totaling $55,030 during the period ended July 31, 2022. These payments are considered contributions to the company with no expectation of repayment and are posted as additional paid-in capital. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company recognized donated capital from its wholly owned subsidiary, Store Foods, as additional paid-in capital in the amount of $8,673. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our net cash used in operating activities totaled $(1,530,628), whereas for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, our net cash used in operating activities totaled $(1,642,176). \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our net cash used in investing activities totaled $12,290, whereas for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, our net cash used in investing activities totaled $(980,539). The variance between periods is primarily attributable to significantly more cash paid for fixed assets during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,637,774, whereas for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, our net cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,688,659. This variance is primarily attributable to a greater amount of cash received from the sale of stock during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\n", "item_7a": " Item 7A.
