Risk Factors \n\nYou should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties below and the other information contained in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we may face. The following risks, together with additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could impair our financial condition and results of operation. \n\nRisks Relating to Our Business \n\nThe EPA has issued small refinery waivers to the RFS requirement which has resulted in demand destruction and negatively impacted profitability in the ethanol industry . During 2019, the ethanol industry learned that the EPA had been issuing small refinery waivers to the ethanol use requirements in the RFS. In previous years, when the EPA issued small refinery waivers, it reallocated the waived requirements to other refiners. The EPA under the Trump Administration was granting significantly more waivers than in the past and was not reallocating the waived amounts to other refiners. These actions resulted in demand destruction starting in 2018 which continued to result in reduced demand for ethanol through 2019. This reduction in ethanol demand negatively impacted profitability in the ethanol industry. These small refinery waivers could be issued in future years which could impact ethanol demand. \n\nA decrease in the spread between the price we receive for our products and our raw material costs will negatively impact our profitability . Practically all of our revenue is derived from the sale of our ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil. Our primary raw material costs are corn costs and energy costs. Our profitability depends on a positive spread between the market price of the ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil we produce and the raw material costs related to these products. While ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil prices typically change in relation to corn prices, this correlation may not always exist. In the event the prices for our products decrease at a time when our raw material costs are increasing, we may not be able to profitably operate the plant. In the event the spread between the price we receive for our products and the raw material costs associated with producing those products is negative for an extended period of time, we may not be able to maintain liquidity which could negatively impact the value of our units. \n\n&#160; Declines in the price of ethanol, distillers grain or corn oil would significantly reduce our revenues . The sales prices of ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil can be volatile as a result of a number of factors such as overall supply and demand, the price of gasoline and corn, levels of government support, tariffs and import quotas, and the availability and price of competing products. We are dependent on a favorable spread between the price we receive for our ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil and the price we pay for corn and natural gas. Any lowering of ethanol, distillers grains, or corn oil prices, especially if it is associated with increases in corn and natural gas prices, may affect our ability to operate profitably. We anticipate the price of ethanol and distillers grains to continue to be volatile in our 2024 fiscal year as a result of the net effect of changes in the price of gasoline and corn and increased ethanol supply offset by increased export demand. In addition, growing conditions in a particular season&#8217;s harvest may cause the corn crop to be of poor quality resulting in corn shortages and a decrease in distillers grains prices. Declines in the prices we receive for our ethanol and distillers grains will lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate the ethanol plant profitably for an extended period of time which could decrease the value of our units. \n\n&#160; Decreasing gasoline prices could negatively impact our ability to operate profitably . Discretionary blending is an important secondary market which is often determined by the price of ethanol versus the price of gasoline. In periods when discretionary blending is financially unattractive, demand for ethanol may be reduced. Historically, the price of ethanol has been less than the price of gasoline which increased demand for ethanol from fuel blenders. In recent years, low oil prices reduced the price of gasoline which reduced the spread between the price of gasoline and the price of ethanol which discouraged discretionary blending, and resulted in a downward market adjustment in the price of ethanol. If oil and gasoline prices remain lower for a significant period of time, it could hurt our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant which could decrease the value of our units. \n\n&#160; Increases in the price of corn or natural gas would reduce our profitability . Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by the cost and supply of corn and natural gas. Changes in the price and supply of corn and natural gas are subject to and determined by market forces over which we have no control including weather and general economic factors. \n\nEthanol production requires substantial amounts of corn. Generally, higher corn prices will produce lower profit margins and, therefore, negatively affect our financial performance. If a period of high corn prices were to be sustained for some time, such pricing may reduce our ability to operate profitably because of the higher cost of operating our plant. We may not be able to offset any increase in the price of corn by increasing the price of our products. If we cannot offset increases in the price of corn, our financial performance may be negatively affected. \n\nThe prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond our control such as higher prices as a result of colder than average weather conditions or natural disasters, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulations and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair our ability to manufacture ethanol and more significantly, distillers grains for our customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \n\n&#160; Our business is not diversified which could negatively impact our ability to operate profitably . Our success depends largely on our ability to profitably operate our ethanol plant. We do not have any other lines of business or other sources of revenue. If economic or political factors adversely affect the market for ethanol, distillers grains, or corn oil, we have no other line of business to fall back on. Our business would also be significantly harmed if the ethanol plant could not operate at full capacity for any extended period of time. \n\n&#160; Our inability to maintain or secure credit facilities we may require in the future may negatively impact our liquidity . While we do not currently require more financing than we have, in the future we may need additional financing. If we require financing in the future and we are unable to secure such financing, or we are unable to secure the financing we require on reasonable terms, it may have a negative impact on our liquidity. This could negatively impact the value of our units. \n\nWe engage in hedging transactions which involve risks that could harm our business . &#160; We are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices, including the prices we pay for our raw materials and the prices we receive for our finished products. We seek to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of corn, ethanol and distillers grains through the use of hedging instruments. However, our hedging activities may not successfully reduce the risk caused by price fluctuations which may leave us vulnerable to volatility in corn, ethanol and distillers grains prices. Alternatively, we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions in the future and our operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected during periods in which the prices for these commodities fluctuate. Further, using cash for margin calls to support our hedge positions can have an impact on the cash we have available for our operations which could negatively impact our liquidity. The effects of our hedging activities may negatively impact our ability to profitably operate which could reduce the value of our units. \n\nWe may violate the terms of our credit agreements and financial covenants which could result in our lender demanding immediate repayment of our loans . Management anticipates that we will be in compliance with our loan covenants in our loans. However, if we violate the terms of our credit agreement, Cornerstone Bank could deem us in default of our loans and require us to immediately repay any outstanding balance of our loans. If we do not have sufficient cash to repay these loans or if we are unable to secure other sources of financing, it could negatively impact the value of our units. \n\nChanges and advances in ethanol production technology could require us to incur costs to update the ethanol plant or could otherwise hinder our ability to compete in the ethanol industry or operate profitably . &#160; Advances and changes in the technology of ethanol production are expected to occur, including the potential use of A.I. technology. Such advances and changes may make the ethanol production technology installed in our ethanol plant less desirable or obsolete. These advances could allow our competitors to produce ethanol at a lower cost than us. If we are unable to adopt or incorporate technological advances, our ethanol production methods and processes could be less efficient than our competitors, which could cause the ethanol plant to become uncompetitive or completely obsolete. If our competitors develop, obtain, or license technology that is superior to ours or that makes our technology obsolete, we may be required to incur significant costs to enhance or acquire new technology so that our ethanol production remains competitive. Alternatively, we may be required to seek third-party licenses, which could also result in significant expenditures. These third-party licenses may not be available or, once obtained, they may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. These costs could negatively impact our financial performance by increasing our operating costs and reducing our net income which could decrease the value of our units. \n\nWe depend on our management and key employees, and the loss of these relationships could negatively impact our ability to operate profitably . We are highly dependent on our management team to operate our ethanol plant. We may not be able to replace these individuals should they decide to cease their employment with us, or if they become unavailable for any other reason. While we seek to compensate our management and key employees in a manner that will encourage them to continue their employment with us, they may choose to seek other employment. Any loss of these officers and key employees may prevent us from operating the ethanol plant profitably and could decrease the value of our units. \n\nFailures of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on operations. We utilize various software applications and other information technology that are critically important to our business operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, including production, manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing, and administrative functions. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to communicate internally and externally with employees, customers, suppliers, and others. We also use information technology networks and systems to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. These information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. \n\nA cyber attack or other information security breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations and result in financial losses. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. If we are unable to prevent cyber attacks and other information security breaches, we may encounter significant disruptions in our operations which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Such breaches may also harm our reputation, result in financial losses or subject us to litigation or other costs or penalties. \n\nAdverse weather conditions, including as a result of climate change, may adversely affect the availability, quality, and price of agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products, as well as our operations and operating results. Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, reduce demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us. Higher basis levels or adverse crop conditions in our corn purchase area can increase the input costs or lower the market value of our products relative to other market participants that do not have the same geographic concentration. Additionally, the potential physical impacts of climate change are uncertain and may vary by region. These potential effects could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels that could adversely impact our costs and business operations, the location, costs, and competitiveness of agricultural commodity production and related storage and processing facilities and the supply and demand for agricultural commodities. These effects could be material to our results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources and could reduce the value of our units. \n\nInvestor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels, and other ESG matters could adversely affect our business, cost of capital, and the price of our stock and other securities. There have been efforts in recent years, which intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at the investment community, to promote the divestment of securities of energy companies, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies. As a result, some financial intermediaries, investors, and other capital markets participants have reduced or ceased lending to, or investing in, companies that operate in industries with higher perceived environmental exposure, such as the energy industry. If this or similar divestment efforts are continued, the value of our units may be negatively impacted. \n\nMembers of the investment community are also increasing their focus on ESG practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to GHGs and climate change in the energy industry in particular, and diversity and inclusion initiatives and governance standards among companies more generally. As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our ESG practices and disclosures. Additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for ESG performance. If we are unable to meet the ESG standards or investment or lending criteria set by these investors and \n\nfunds, we may lose investors, investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us, our cost of capital may increase, the price of our units may be negatively impacted, and our reputation may also be negatively affected. \n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia and resulting sanctions by the United States, European Union and other countries have contributed to inflation, market disruptions and increased volatility in commodity prices in the United States and a slowdown in global economic growth. On February 24, 2022, a military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. In response to the attacks on Ukraine, sanctions and other penalties have been levied by the United States, European Union, and other countries and additional sanctions and penalties have been proposed. The invasion by Russia and resulting sanctions have had a broad range of adverse impacts on global business and financial markets some of which have had and may continue to have adverse impacts on our business. These include increased inflation, significant market disruptions and increased volatility in commodity prices such as corn, oil and natural gas. Although the duration and extent of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable and the magnitude of the potential economic impact is currently unknown, Russian military actions and resulting sanctions could have a negative effect on our financial condition and operating results. \n\nRisks Related to the Ethanol Industry \n\nThe ethanol industry is an industry that is changing rapidly which can result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations and the value of our units . The ethanol industry has grown significantly in the last decade. This rapid growth has resulted in significant shifts in supply and demand of ethanol over a very short period of time. As a result, past performance by the ethanol plant or the ethanol industry generally might not be indicative of future performance. We may experience a rapid shift in the economic conditions in the ethanol industry which may make it difficult to operate the ethanol plant profitably. If changes occur in the ethanol industry that make it difficult for us to operate the ethanol plant profitably, it could result in a reduction in the value of our units. \n\nIncreased competition from electric vehicles could reduce demand for liquid fuels which could negatively impact demand for ethanol which could negatively impact our profitability . Electric car technology has improved significantly in recent years and many automakers are focusing on electric car technology for automobiles they are releasing or plan to release in the future. Increased reliance on electric vehicle technology is expected to result in decreased gasoline demand. Recently, governments and private entities have focused on improving and expanding vehicle recharging stations which may make electric automobiles more attractive in the market. As gasoline powered vehicles become a smaller part of the worldwide vehicle fleet, it is expected to have a negative impact on gasoline demand which will also impact ethanol demand. This shift in demand could negatively impact our financial performance and could reduce or eliminate the value of our units. \n\nExcess ethanol supply in the market could put negative pressure on the price of ethanol which could lead to tight operating margins and may impact our ability to operate profitably . In the past the ethanol industry has confronted market conditions where ethanol supply exceeded demand which led to unfavorable operating conditions. A disconnect between ethanol supply and demand can result in lower ethanol prices which can result in unfavorable operating conditions. The United States has recently benefited from additional exports of ethanol which may not continue to occur during our 2024 fiscal year. We may experience periods of ethanol supply and demand imbalance during our 2024 fiscal year, particularly if the EPA issues additional small refinery waivers from the RFS. If we experience excess ethanol supply, either due to increased ethanol production, lower ethanol demand or lower overall gasoline demand, it could negatively impact the price of ethanol which could hurt our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. \n\n&#160; Distillers grains demand and prices have been negatively impacted by the Chinese anti-dumping duty . China was previously the world's largest importer of distillers grains produced in the United States. On January 12, 2016, the Chinese government announced that it would commence an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation related to distillers grains imported from the United States. On January 10, 2017, China announced a final ruling related to its anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation imposing anti-dumping duties from a range of 42.2% to 53.7% and anti-subsidy duties from 11.2% to 12.0%. The imposition of these duties has resulted in a significant decline in demand from this top importer and negatively impacted prices for distillers grains produced in the United States. Due to trade disputes between the United States and China these tariffs continued into our 2022 fiscal year. In January 2023, the Chinese government extended tariffs on distillers grains from the United States for an additional five years. This reduction in demand has negatively impacted our profitability, and continued tariffs may further impact our profitability. \n\n&#160; Demand for ethanol may not continue to grow unless ethanol can be blended into gasoline in higher percentage blends for standard vehicles . &#160; Currently, ethanol is primarily blended with gasoline for use in standard (non-flex fuel) vehicles to create a blend which is 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. Estimates indicate that approximately 143 billion gallons of gasoline are sold in the United States each year. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and \n\n90% gasoline, the maximum domestic demand for ethanol is 14.3 billion gallons. This is commonly referred to as the \"blend wall,\" which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. Many in the ethanol industry believe that the ethanol industry has reached and surpassed this blend wall. In order to expand demand for ethanol, higher percentage blends of ethanol must be utilized in standard vehicles. Such higher percentage blends of ethanol are a contentious issue. Automobile manufacturers and environmental groups have fought against higher percentage ethanol blends. The EPA approved the use of E15 for standard vehicles produced in the model year 2001 and later. The fact that E15 has not been approved for use in all vehicles and the labeling requirements associated with E15 may lead to gasoline retailers refusing to carry E15. Without an increase in the allowable percentage blends of ethanol that can be used in all vehicles, demand for ethanol may not continue to increase which could decrease the selling price of ethanol and could result in our inability to operate the ethanol plant profitably which could reduce or eliminate the value of our units. \n\nA reduction in ethanol exports to Brazil due to the imposition by the Brazilian government of a tariff on U.S. ethanol has and could continue to have a negative impact on ethanol prices . Brazil has historically been a top destination for ethanol produced in the United States. However, in 2017, Brazil imposed a tariff on ethanol which is produced in the United States and exported to Brazil. This tariff has resulted in a decline in demand for ethanol from Brazil in the past and could negatively impact the market price of ethanol in the United States and could negatively impact our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. \n\nChinese ethanol tariffs have and could continue to have a negative impact on ethanol prices . As a result of trade disputes between the United States and China, China imposed a 45% tariff on ethanol produced in the United States. This tariff has effectively closed the Chinese market for United States ethanol exports. China represents a significant potential source of demand for ethanol. Without access to the Chinese market, we may experience excess ethanol supply which could negatively impact ethanol prices in the United States. Lower ethanol prices could negatively impact our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. \n\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry and compete with larger, better financed entities which could impact our ability to operate profitably. &#160; There is significant competition among ethanol producers. There are numerous producer-owned and privately-owned ethanol plants operating throughout the Midwest and elsewhere in the United States. We also face competition from outside of the United States. The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET, and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which is capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. Further, many believe that there will be further consolidation occurring in the ethanol industry in the future which could lead to a few companies which control a significant portion of the United States ethanol production market. We may not be able to compete with these larger entities. These larger ethanol producers may be able to affect the ethanol market in ways that are not beneficial to us which could negatively impact our financial performance. \n\nTechnology advances in the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol may decrease demand for corn-based ethanol which may negatively affect our profitability . &#160; The current trend in ethanol production research is to develop an efficient method of producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass, such as agricultural waste, forest residue, municipal solid waste, and energy crops. This trend is driven by the fact that cellulose-based biomass is generally cheaper than corn, and producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass would create opportunities to produce ethanol in areas of the country which are unable to grow corn. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the 2008 Farm Bill offer strong incentives to develop commercial scale cellulosic ethanol. Additionally, state and federal grants have been awarded to several companies which are seeking to develop commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol plants. This has encouraged innovation and has led to several companies which are either in the process or have completed construction of commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants. If an efficient method of producing ethanol from cellulose-based biomass is developed, we may not be able to compete effectively. If we are unable to produce ethanol as cost-effectively as cellulose-based producers, our ability to generate revenue and our financial condition will be negatively impacted. \n\nRisks Related to Regulation and Governmental Action \n\n&#160; Government incentives for ethanol production may be eliminated in the future, which could hinder our ability to operate at a profit . The ethanol industry is assisted by various federal ethanol production and tax incentives, including the RFS set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The RFS helps support a market for ethanol that might disappear without this incentive. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has the authority to annually EPA passes a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligations. In the past, the EPA has set the renewable volume obligations below the statutory volume requirements. In addition, the EPA has recently expanded its use of waivers to small refineries. The effect of these waivers is that the refinery is no longer required to earn or purchase blending credits, known as RINs, negatively affecting ethanol demand and resulting in lower ethanol prices. If the EPA were to significantly reduce the volume requirements under the RFS or if the \n\nRFS were to be otherwise reduced or eliminated by the exercise of the EPA waiver authority or by Congress, the market price and demand for ethanol could decrease which will negatively impact our financial performance. \n\n&#160; Changes in environmental regulations or violations of these regulations could be expensive and reduce our profitability . We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental laws and regulations. In addition, some of these laws require our plant to operate under a number of environmental permits. These laws, regulations and permits can often require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or plant shutdowns. In the future, we may be subject to legal actions brought by environmental advocacy groups and other parties for actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or our permits. Additionally, any changes in environmental laws and regulations, both at the federal and state level, could require us to spend considerable resources in order to comply with future environmental regulations. The expense of compliance could be significant enough to reduce our profitability and negatively affect our financial condition. \n\n&#160; The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard may decrease demand for corn based ethanol which could negatively impact our profitability . California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard (\"LCFS\") which requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which reductions are measured using a lifecycle analysis. Management believes that these regulations could preclude corn-based ethanol produced in the Midwest from being used in California. California represents a significant ethanol demand market. If the ethanol industry is unable to supply corn-based ethanol to California, it could significantly reduce demand for the ethanol we produce which could result in a reduction of our revenues and negatively impact our ability to profitably operate the ethanol plant. \n\n&#160; Government policies and regulations, particularly those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Agricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, trade tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions on commodities and commodity products, can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and the volume and types of imports and exports. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Future governmental policies, regulations, or actions affecting our industry may adversely affect the supply of, demand for and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business and cause our financial results to suffer. \n\nNew, stricter environmental laws and other industry-related regulations or environmental litigation could significantly impact our operations and/or increase our costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are subject to federal, state, and municipal laws and regulations regulating environmental matters. The trend in environmental regulation has been towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment over time. For example, President Biden signed an executive order calling for new or more stringent emissions standards. Our business may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. Risks related to our environmental permits, including the risk of noncompliance, permit interpretation, permit modification, renewal of permits on less favorable terms, judicial or administrative challenges to permits by citizens groups or federal, state, or municipal entities or permit revocation are inherent in the operation of our business as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We may not be able to renew the permits necessary for our operations, or we may be forced to accept terms in future permits that limit our operations or result in additional compliance costs. There can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. In recent years environmental interest groups have filed suit against companies in the energy industry related to climate change. Should such suits succeed, we could face additional compliance costs or litigation risks. \n\n", "item_7": "", "item_7a": " ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices as discussed below. We have no exposure to foreign currency risk as all of our business is conducted in U.S. Dollars and we have immaterial exposure to interest rate risk as we had $10 million outstanding on variable interest debt indexed to prime interest rates. We use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk. We use cash, futures and option contracts to hedge changes to the commodity prices of corn and ethanol. We do not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes pursuant to the requirements of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). \n\nCommodity Price Risk \n\n&#160; \n\nWe expect to be exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices. Exposure to commodity price risk results from our dependence on corn in the ethanol production process and the sale of ethanol. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe enter into fixed price contracts for corn purchases on a regular basis. It is our intent that, as we enter into these contracts, we will use various hedging instruments (puts, calls, and futures) to maintain a near even market position. For example, if we have 1 million bushels of corn under fixed price contracts we would generally expect to enter into a short hedge position to offset our price risk relative to those bushels we have under fixed price contracts. Because our ethanol marketing company (RPMG) is selling substantially all of the gallons it markets on a spot basis we also include the corn bushel equivalent of the ethanol we have produced that is inventory but not yet priced as bushels that need to be hedged. \n\n&#160; \n\nAlthough we believe our hedge positions will accomplish an economic hedge against our future purchases, they are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, which would match the gain or loss on our hedge positions to the specific commodity purchase being hedged. We use fair value accounting for our hedge positions, which means as the current market price of our hedge positions changes, the gains and losses are immediately recognized in our cost of sales. The immediate recognition of hedging gains and losses under fair value accounting can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing of the change in value of derivative instruments relative to the cost of the commodity being hedged. However, it is likely that commodity cash prices will have the greatest impact on the derivatives instruments with delivery dates nearest the current cash price. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 6 million bushels of corn under fixed price contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nIt is the current position of our ethanol marketing company, RPMG, that under current market conditions selling ethanol in the spot market will yield the best price for our ethanol. RPMG will, from time to time, contract a portion of the gallons they market with fixed price contracts. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe estimate that our expected corn usage will be between 20 million and 23 million bushels per calendar year for the production of approximately 59 million to 64 million gallons of ethanol. As corn prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statements will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments. \n\n&#160; \n\nA sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate our exposure to corn, natural gas, and ethanol price risk. Market risk related to our corn, natural gas and ethanol prices is estimated as the potential change in income resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the average cost of our corn and natural gas, and our average ethanol sales price as of September 30, 2023, net of the forward and future contracts used to hedge our market risk for corn, natural gas and ethanol. The volumes are based on our expected use and sale of these commodities for a one year period from September 30, 2023. The results of this analysis, which may differ from actual results, are as follows: \n\n##TABLE_START Estimated Volume Requirements for the next 12 months (net of forward and futures contracts) Unit of Measure Hypothetical Adverse Change in Price Approximate Adverse Change to Income Ethanol 63,900,000 Gallons 10 % $ (15,975,000) Corn 20,600,000 Bushels 10 % $ (10,648,312) Natural gas 1,664,000 MMBtu 10 % $ (374,000) ##TABLE_END\n\nFor comparison purposes, below is our analysis for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. \n\n##TABLE_START Estimated Volume Requirements for the next 12 months (net of forward and futures contracts) Unit of Measure Hypothetical Adverse Change in Price Approximate Adverse Change to Income Ethanol 63,900,000 Gallons 10 % $ (14,697,000) Corn 20,600,000 Bushels 10 % $ (14,008,000) Natural gas 1,664,000 MMBtu 10 % $ (1,464,000) ##TABLE_END\n\n"}
