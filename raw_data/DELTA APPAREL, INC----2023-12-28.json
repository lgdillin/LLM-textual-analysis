{"companyName": "DELTA APPAREL, INC", "filedAt": "2023-12-28T17:17:24-05:00", "item_1a": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\n&#160;\n\nWe operate in a rapidly changing, highly competitive business environment that involves substantial risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks identified below. The following risks, as well as risks described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results and the value of Company securities held by investors and should be carefully considered in evaluating our Company and the forward-looking statements contained in this report or future reports. The risks described below are not the only risks facing Delta Apparel. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently do not view as material may become material and may impair our business operations. Any of these risks could cause, or contribute to causing, our actual results to differ materially from expectations.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to our Strategy \n\n&#160;\n\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan and achieve our business strategies. \n\nWe continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to enhance our capabilities, strengthen the foundation of our Company, and accelerate profitable growth across our business segments. There can be no assurance that these or other future strategic initiatives will be successful to the extent we expect, or at all. Additionally, we are investing resources in these initiatives and the costs of the initiatives may outweigh their benefits. If we miscalculate the resources we need to complete these strategic initiatives or fail to implement them effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur strategy to grow our direct-to-consumer retail business depends upon our ability to successfully open and operate new stores in a timely and cost-effective manner. \n\nOur strategy to grow our &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; retail footprint depends on many factors including, among others, our ability to: identify desirable store locations; negotiate acceptable lease terms; hire, train and retain a growing workforce of store managers, sales associates and other personnel; successfully integrate new stores into our existing control structure and operations, including our information technology systems; and coordinate well with our digital platforms and wholesale customers to minimize the competition within our sales channels. As we expand into new geographic areas, we need to successfully identify and satisfy the consumer preferences in these areas. In addition, we need to address competitive, merchandising, marketing, distribution and other challenges encountered in connection with any expansion. Finally, we cannot ensure that any newly-opened stores will be received as well as, or achieve net sales or profitability levels comparable to those of, our existing stores in our estimated time periods, or at all. If our stores fail to achieve, or are unable to sustain, acceptable net sales and profitability levels, our business overall may be materially harmed, and we may incur significant costs associated with closing or relocating stores.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe apparel industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competitive threats to our business. \n\nThe market for activewear apparel and the related accessory and other items we provide is highly competitive and includes many new participants as well as increased competition from established companies, some of which are larger or more diversified and may have greater financial resources. Many of our competitors also have larger sales forces, stronger brand recognition among consumers, bigger advertising budgets, and/or greater economies of scale. We compete with these companies primarily on the basis of price, quality, service and brand recognition, all of which are important competitive factors in the apparel industry. Our ability to maintain our competitive edge depends upon these factors, as well as our ability to deliver new products at the best value for the customer, maintain positive brand recognition, and obtain sufficient retail floor space and effective product presentation at retail. If we are unable to compete successfully with our competitors, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe availability of our key raw materials or raw material price volatility may interrupt our supply chains and materially harm our business. \n\nCotton is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of our apparel products. As is the case with other commodities, the price of cotton fluctuates and is affected by weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, inflation, the cost of labor and transportation, and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. As described under the heading &#8220;Manufacturing, Sourcing, and Distribution,&#8221; the price of yarn purchased from Parkdale, our key supplier, is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost. We set future cotton prices with purchase commitments as a component of the purchase price of yarn in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from Parkdale. Prices are set according to prevailing prices, as reported by the New York Cotton Exchange, at the time we enter into the commitments. Thus, we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements, which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us. In the past, the Company, and the apparel industry as a whole, has experienced periods of increased cotton costs and price volatility. By way of example, the price of cotton per pound increased almost 50% in a five-month period and reached a high of over $1.50 in our fiscal year 2022. In some instances, we were unable to pass through these higher costs to our customers, with the gross margins in our Activewear and other businesses negatively impacted as a result. In addition, sudden decreases in the price of cotton and other raw materials may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production, which may result in downward selling price pressures, negatively impacting the gross margins in our Activewear and other businesses by significant amounts.\n\n&#160;\n\nAdditionally, if Parkdale&#8217;s operations are disrupted and Parkdale is not able to provide us with our yarn requirements, we may need to obtain yarn from alternative sources. We may not be able to enter into short-term arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as our current terms with Parkdale, which could negatively affect our business. In addition, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of yarn from alternative sources, which could require us to adjust manufacturing levels, negatively impacting our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations also require significant amounts of dyes and chemicals that we purchase from several third-party suppliers. While historically we have not had difficulty obtaining sufficient quantities of dyes and chemicals for manufacturing, the availability of products can change, which could require us to adjust dye and chemical formulations. In certain instances, these adjustments can increase manufacturing costs, negatively impacting our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to predict or effectively react to changing consumer preferences and trends. \n\nThe success of our businesses depends on our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer demand and preferences in apparel and other items we provide. We believe that our brands are recognized by consumers across many demographics and geographies. The popularity of particular products can change significantly from year-to-year based on prevailing fashion trends (particularly in our lifestyle businesses) and on other factors and, accordingly, our ability to adapt to fashion trends in designing products is important to the success of our brands. If we are unable to quickly adapt to changes in consumer preferences in the design of our products, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, because we and our customers project demand for our products based on estimated sales and fashion trends, the actual demand for our products sometimes falls short of what was projected. This can lead to higher inventory levels than desired. Excess inventory levels increase our working capital needs, and sometimes excess inventory must be sold at discounted prices, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf our advertising, marketing and promotional programs are ineffective, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs, our sales could be negatively affected. \n\nIneffective marketing, advertising and promotional programs could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and could ultimately decrease sales. While we market our products and attract customers, some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do, or use different approaches than we do that prove more successful, any of which may provide them with a competitive advantage. If our programs are not effective or require increased expenditures that are not offset by increased sales, our revenue and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to our Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments, and it or any other global or regional pandemic or similar event could have material adverse impacts on our business going forward. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic adversely effected our performance, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments and also impacted all regions around the world, resulting in restrictions and shutdowns implemented by national, state, and local authorities. During our fiscal year 2020, these requirements resulted in temporary closures of all of our branded retail locations and our manufacturing facilities in El Salvador, Honduras Mexico, and North Carolina. Many of our customers and suppliers also faced these and other challenges, which resulted in supply chain and logistic constraints, closure of certain third-party manufacturers and increased freight costs at various stages of the pandemic. Any further or similar temporary or long-term disruption in our supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other global or regional pandemic or similar event could lead to reduced demand for our products and services and could impair our customers&#8217; ability to pay all or portion of the amounts owed to us. We rely on suppliers and third-parties to deliver raw materials and transport our finished goods. Prolonged inventory shortages may result in significant lost business or delay in shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any similar global or regional event impacts or continues to impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the ultimate duration, severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus or any similar event, the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus or any similar dynamic, and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants or any similar event, or treat their respective impacts. Any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or the occurrence of any similar global or regional event would likely result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we, or the third parties with whom we engage, operate. The long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of any such event, including but not limited to, possible impairment, restructuring, and other charges, as well as overall impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital resources and investments, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations are subject to political, social, and economic risks in Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico. \n\nThe majority of our products are manufactured in Honduras and, El Salvador and, previously, Mexico before we began the process of closing our sewing and screenprint operations in Mexico during fiscal year 2023 that we will finalize in the early part of fiscal year 2024. These countries from time-to-time experience political, social and economic instability, and we cannot be certain of their future stability. Instability in a country can lead to protests, riots and labor unrest. Governments have changed, and may continue to change, and employment, wage and other laws and regulations may change, thereby increasing our costs to operate in those countries. Any of these political, social, or economic events or conditions could disrupt our supply chain or increase our costs, adversely affecting our financial position and results of operations. For example, in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our operations in and around San Pedro Sula, Honduras, were partially disrupted by protests and strikes related to increasing fuel costs and the impact related to higher ticket prices on public transportation. These disruptions temporarily restricted the ability of our employees and suppliers to access our manufacturing facilities as well as our ability to ship products from our facilities, and negatively impacted our operations from cost and other standpoints. \n\n&#160;\n\nIf we experience disruptions or interruptions within any of our facilities, operations, or distribution networks, we may be unable to deliver our products to the market and may lose sales and customers. \n\nWe own or lease manufacturing facilities in the United States, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico (our Mexico leases will terminate in early 2024 in connection with our decision to close our sewing and screenprint operations there). We also own or lease distribution facilities located throughout the United States and maintain inventory at certain third-party locations. Any casualty or other circumstance that damages or destroys any of these material facilities or significantly limits their ability to function could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, any significant interruption in the operation of any of these facilities or our related sourcing and transportation logistics functions, whether within or outside of our control, may delay shipment of merchandise to our customers, potentially damaging our reputation and customer relationships and causing a loss of revenue. Moreover, in the event of a regional disruption where we manufacture our products, we may not be able to shift our operations to a different geographic region, and we may have to cease or curtail our operations in a selected area. This may cause us to lose sales and customers. The types of disruptions that may occur include foreign trade disruptions, import restrictions, labor disruptions, embargoes, government intervention, natural disasters, regional or global pandemics and political disruptions such as those referenced in the immediately preceding paragraph of this section. In addition, if we are unable to successfully coordinate the planning of inventory across these facilities and the related distribution activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe talents and continued contributions of our key management team are important to our success. \n\nWe believe our future success depends on our ability to retain and motivate our key management team, our ability to attract and integrate new members of management into our operations, and the ability of all personnel to work together effectively as a team and to execute our business strategy. Our inability to accomplish any of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf any of the third parties upon whom we rely to provide certain key equipment and services fails to satisfy their obligations to us in the future, we may suffer a disruption to our business. \n\nWe rely on certain key equipment and services provided by various third parties, including logistics partners and equipment suppliers. For example, we rely on third parties to provide certain inbound and outbound transportation and delivery services and other third parties to provide us with key equipment to support our manufacturing and fulfillment platforms, including our DTG2Go digital platform. If any of these or other third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or does not provide properly functioning equipment or services to us in the future, we may suffer a disruption to our business or increased costs. Further, we may be unable to implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us.\n\n&#160;\n\nEnergy, fuel and related costs are prone to significant fluctuations and volatility, which could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nOur manufacturing operations require high inputs of energy, and changes in energy prices directly impact our gross profits. In addition, we incur significant freight costs to transport goods between our offshore facilities and the United States, along with transportation expenses to ship products to our customers. The cost of energy and fuel fluctuates due to a number of factors outside of our control, including government policy and regulation, supply disruptions, inflation, and weather conditions. Many of these factors impacted such cost in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and may have an impact going forward. To mitigate the risk of fluctuations in energy costs, we continue to focus on methods that will reduce the amount of energy used in the manufacture of our products. However, significant increases in energy and fuel prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, especially if such increases make us less competitive compared to others in our industry.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business operations rely on our information systems and any material disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause operational delays, reputational harm, or loss of revenue. \n\nWe depend on information systems to, among other things, manage our inventory, process transactions, operate our websites, respond to customer inquiries, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis, and maintain cost-effective operations. Management uses information systems to support decision-making and to monitor business performance. If we experience any disruptions or slowdowns with our information systems, we may fail to generate accurate and complete financial and operational reports essential for making decisions at various levels of management, which could lead to decisions being made that have adverse results. We have invested significant capital and expect future capital expenditures associated with the implementation and integration of our information technology systems across our businesses. This process involves the replacement and consolidation of technology platforms so that our businesses are served by fewer platforms, resulting in operational efficiencies and reduced costs. Our inability to effectively implement or convert our operations to the new systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations. Further, if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the internet, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brands. In addition, we interact with many of our customers through our websites. Customers increasingly utilize our online platforms to purchase our merchandise. If we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platforms to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our ecommerce and other businesses and our sales may be negatively impacted. If our websites contain errors or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, it could result in damage to our brands&#8217; images and a loss of revenue. In addition, we may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, &#8220;cyber-attacks,&#8221; computer viruses, security breaches, disasters or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of our information systems could cause operational delays and increased costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nCompromises of our data security could lead to liability and reputational damage. &#160;\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we often collect, retain, transmit, and use sensitive and confidential information regarding customers and employees, and we process customer payment card and check information. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data compromise, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information, or that any such data compromise or access will be discovered in a timely manner. Further, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches (including via computer hackings), unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, phishing or other failures or disruptions that could result in disruption to our business or the loss or theft of confidential information, including customer information. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems could result in the misappropriation of personal information, payment card or check information or confidential business information of our Company. In addition, there may be non-technical issues, such as our employees, contractors or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe methods used by third parties to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be anticipated or immediately detected. Thus, despite the security measures we may have in place, an actual or perceived information security breach, whether due to &#8220;cyber-attack,\" computer viruses or other malicious software code, or human error or malfeasance, could occur. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur significant costs to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber-attack, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, repair damage to our systems, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. The collection, retention, transmission, and use of personal information is subject to contractual requirements and is highly regulated by a multitude of state, federal, and foreign laws. Privacy and information security laws are complex and constantly changing. Compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs due to new systems and processes, and our non-compliance could lead to legal liability. Any compromise of our customer, employee or company data, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information, or delay in detecting or providing prompt notice of any such compromise could attract media attention, damage our customer or other business relationships and reputation, result in lost sales, fines, liability for stolen assets or information, costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business, significant litigation or other costs and involve the loss of confidential company information, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nExtreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events, including those caused by climate change, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which our manufacturing facilities, retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers, data centers, and offices are located could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or wildfires, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political instability, or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our suppliers or customers or result in economic instability that could negatively impact customer spending, any or all of which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, fire and other natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods have occurred and can recur in the countries in which we operate. These types of events could impact our global supply chain, including the ability of suppliers to provide raw materials where and when needed, the ability of third parties to ship merchandise, and our ability to ship products from or to the impacted region(s). \n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, climate change and the increased focus by governments, organizations, customers, and investors on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change and socially responsible activities, may adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, and stakeholders have focused increasingly on environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, and related sustainability practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards (which are continually evolving and may emphasize different priorities than the ones we choose to focus on), then our brand, reputation, and potential employee retention may be negatively impacted. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices and regulations. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to manage reputational threats and meet expectations with respect to socially responsible activities and sustainability commitments could negatively impact our brand credibility, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters \n\n&#160;\n\nChanges in U.S. or other tax laws or regulations may cause us to incur additional tax liability. \n\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions where we generate net operating profits. We generally benefit from a lower overall effective income tax rate due to the majority of our manufacturing operations being located in foreign tax-free jurisdictions or foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are lower than those in the United States. Our U.S. legal entity contracts with our foreign subsidiaries to manufacture products on its behalf, with the intercompany prices paid for the manufacturing services and manufactured products based on an arms-length standard and supported by an economic study.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe December 22, 2017, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;2017 Tax Legislation&#8221;) significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax code by, among other things, lowering federal corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax (&#8220;transition tax&#8221;) on deemed repatriated cumulative earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, new taxes were imposed related to foreign income, including a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;), a limitation on the deduction for business interest expense (&#8220;Section 163(j)&#8221;), and a limitation on the deductibility of a company&#8217;s net operating losses (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;). GILTI is the excess of the shareholder&#8217;s net controlled foreign corporations' (&#8220;CFCs&#8221;) net tested income over the deemed tangible income. The Section 163(j) limitation does not allow the amount of deductible interest to exceed the sum of the taxpayer&#8217;s business interest income or 30% of the taxpayer&#8217;s adjusted taxable income. U.S. federal NOLs cannot fully offset taxable income and carryforward indefinitely. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, provided temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws, including some provisions which were previously enacted under the 2017 Tax Legislation. The CARES Act also revised the U.S. corporate income tax code on a temporary basis by, among other things, eliminating the 80% of taxable income limitation on net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforwards, allowing NOL carrybacks, and increasing the Section 163(j) interest limitation deduction from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between the U.S. and tax-free or lower-tax foreign jurisdictions. We may be limited in our ability to deduct 50% of applicable foreign earnings under the GILTI income inclusion or to deduct U.S. interest expense based on the amount of U.S. taxable income earned in a particular fiscal year. In addition, the future impact of the CARES Act and 2017 Tax Legislation may differ from historical amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made regarding the CARES Act and 2017 Tax Legislation, guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the CARES Act and 2017 Tax Legislation.\n\n&#160;\n\nFurther changes to U.S. tax laws, including those impacting how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on U.S. and foreign earnings, such as any potential increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, the doubling of the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and a minimum tax on worldwide book income, among other things, could have a material adverse effect on our tax expense and cash flow.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to periodic litigation in both domestic and international jurisdictions that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n\nFrom time to time we may be involved in legal or regulatory actions regarding product liability, employment practices, intellectual property infringement, bankruptcies and other litigation or enforcement matters. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. These proceedings could cause us to incur costs and may require us to devote resources to defend against these claims and could ultimately result in a loss or other remedies such as product recalls, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For a description of current material legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.\n\nProduct liability issues could lead to recalls, claims and negative publicity, and adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nOur operations are subject to certain product liability risks common to most brands and manufacturers and our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products is vital to our success. We have implemented product safety and quality programs and standards that we follow and we expect our supplier partners to strictly adhere to applicable requirements and best practices. In addition to selling apparel and accessory products, we also license one of our brands for use in connection with restaurant, food, and beverage services and home furnishings. We also previously participated in a joint venture involving the sale of a branded alcoholic beverage and previously licensed one of our brands for use in connection with a branded alcoholic beverage. Selling products intended for human consumption carries inherent risks and uncertainties. If we or our supplier or license partners fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards and our products or those otherwise associated with our brands are, or become, unsafe, non-compliant, contaminated or adulterated, we may be required to recall our products and encounter product liability claims and negative publicity. Any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, business or results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe rely on the strength of our trademarks and could incur significant costs to protect these trademarks and our other intellectual property. \n\nOur trademarks, including Salt Life&#174;, Soffe&#174;, Intensity Athletics&#174;, Kudzu&#174;, Pro Weight&#174;, Magnum Weight&#174;, and the Delta Design, among others, are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value. We aggressively protect these trademarks and have incurred legal costs in the past to establish and protect these trademarks. We may in the future be required to expend significant additional resources to protect these trademarks and our other intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation may be costly and may divert management's attention from the operation of our business. Adverse determinations in any litigation may result in the loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nSignificant changes to international trade regulations could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nThe majority of our products are manufactured in Honduras and El Salvador and, previously, Mexico before we began the process of closing our sewing and screenprint operations in Mexico during fiscal year 2023 that we will finalize in the early part of fiscal year 2024. We therefore benefit from current free trade agreements and other duty preference programs, including the Central America Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;CAFTA&#8221;). Our claims for duty free or reduced duty treatment under CAFTA and other available programs are largely conditioned on our ability to produce or obtain accurate records (some of which are provided to us by third parties) about production processes and sources of raw materials. Trade partnerships and treaties can be subjected to negotiations and modifications by domestic and foreign governments, which could result in new or increased tariffs on goods we import into the United States. Subsequent repeal or further modification of CAFTA, further increases to tariffs on goods imported into the United States, or the inadequacy or unavailability of supporting records, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, our products are subject to foreign competition, which in the past has been faced with significant U.S. government import restrictions. The extent of import protection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to remain, subject to political considerations. The reduction or elimination of import protections for domestic apparel producers could significantly increase global competition, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. \n\nThe labeling, distribution, importation, marketing, and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the United States. Any failure to comply with such regulations could cause us to become subject to investigation and enforcement actions resulting in significant penalties or claims or in our inability to conduct business, adversely affecting our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur international operations are also subject to compliance with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented procedures designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, some of our agents or other channel partners, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, could take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nChanges in domestic or foreign employment regulations, changes in our relationship with our employees, and changes in our ability to attract and retain employees could adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nAs of September 30, 2023 , we employed approximately 6,800 employees worldwide, with approximately 5,800 of these employees located in Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. Changes in domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing our relationships with our employees, includ ing wage and human resources laws and regulations, labor standards, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers &#8217; compensation rates, and payroll taxes could impact our relationship with our employees and adversely impact the productivity and ultimate cost of our manufacturing operations. A total of approximately 2,000 employees at two of our facilities in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, are party to multi-year collective bargaining agreements. We have historically conducted our operations without significant labor disruptions and believe that our relations with our employees are generally good. However, a change in labor relation s could adversely affect the productivity and ultimate cost of our manufacturing operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality employees with staffing needs especially high during the holiday season. Competition for personnel is highly competitive, and there is no assurance we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs is subject to many factors such as prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, unemployment levels, and actions by our competitors with respect to compensation levels. Wage rates have increased significantly in the U.S. and wage increases have also occurred in foreign countries in which we operate. Any further significant increases in wage rates in these countries in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. In addition, changes in federal, state, or local laws and regulations relating to employee benefits, including, but not limited to, sick time, paid time off, leave of absence, wage-and-hour, overtime, and meal-and-break time could cause us to incur additional costs. Competitive and regulatory pressures have already significantly increased our labor costs and we may be unable to fully pass these costs to our customers through increased selling prices, which could deteriorate our profitability. In addition, further changes that hurt our ability to attract and retain personnel could adversely affect our results of operations in the future.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe value of our brands, sales of our products and our licensing relationships could be impacted by negative publicity resulting from violations of manufacturing or employee safety standards or labor laws or unethical business practices by our suppliers and independent contractors. \n\nWe are committed to ensuring that all of our manufacturing facilities comply with our strict internal code of conduct, applicable laws and regulations, and the codes and principles to which we subscribe. In addition, we require our suppliers and independent contractors to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them. However, we do not control these suppliers and independent contractors. A violation of our policies, applicable manufacturing or employee safety standards and codes of conduct, labor laws or other laws or regulations by our suppliers or independent contractors could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our operations. Negative publicity regarding the production or operating methods of any of our suppliers or independent contractors or their failure to comply with our policies, applicable manufacturing or employee safety standards and codes of conduct, labor laws or other laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation, brands, sales and licensing relationships, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to Financial Matters \n\n&#160;\n\nEconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products. \n\nThe apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of demand for soft goods, which may or may not coincide with the overall level of discretionary consumer spending. These levels of demand change as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. These economic conditions include, but are not limited to, employment levels, energy costs, interest rates, tax rates, inflation, personal debt levels, and uncertainty about the future, with many of these factors outside of our control. Recent distress in global credit markets, rising interest rates, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, significant geopolitical conflicts, volatility in energy prices, constraints on the global supply chain and other factors continue to affect the global economy and adversely impact demand for our products. In 2022 and 2023, the U.S. experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures. We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of inflation through price increases, productivity initiatives and cost savings, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, if the U.S. economy enters a recession, we may experience sales declines and may have to decrease prices, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Historically, during recessionary periods, the demand for casual and activewear apparel has been strong and our business has performed well. However, there can be no assurances that this correlation will continue in future recessions. Sometimes, the timing of increases or decreases in consumer purchases of soft goods can differ from the timing of increases or decreases in the overall level of economic activity.\n\n&#160;\n\nWeakening sales may require us to reduce manufacturing operations to match our output to demand or expected demand and reductions in our manufacturing operations may increase unit and other costs and lower our gross margins, causing a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, during fiscal year 2023 we experienced significant reductions in demand across our Activewear business due to high inventory levels across the supply chain, particularly channels serving mass retailers, and we made the decision to curtail our production levels to maintain balance with the declining demand. We incurred expenses in connection with our decision to reduce production that amounted to approximately $8.0 million in excess cost during fiscal year 2023, with most of that cost driven by lower fixed cost absorption due to lower production volume and the payment of temporary unemployment benefits to idled employees at our offshore locations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may be restricted in our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility or service our indebtedness. \n\nSignificant operating losses or significant uses of cash in our operations could cause us to default on our asset-based revolving credit facility. We rely on our credit facility, as well as on cash generated by our operations, to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs, to make acquisitions, to fund repurchases under our share repurchase program and to pay dividends should we choose to do so in the future. Our working capital needs are generally greater in advance of the spring and summer selling seasons. Availability under our credit facility is primarily a function of the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory, as well as the uses of cash in our operations. A significant deterioration in our accounts receivable or inventory levels could restrict our ability to borrow additional funds or service our indebtedness. Cash on hand and availability under our U.S. revolving credit facility totaled $14.2 million at September 30, 2023. A significant deterioration in our business could cause us not to satisfy availability, fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR), EBITDA and/or other thresholds in our asset-based revolving credit facility. Moreover, if we failed to satisfy our minimum availability threshold, we would be required to maintain the minimum FCCR specified in our credit agreement, which we may not be able to maintain. The covenants in our credit facility include, among other things, limitations on asset sales, consolidations, mergers, liens, indebtedness, loans, investments, guaranties, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, and transactions with affiliates as well as requirements to complete transactions related to certain assets. If an event of default under our credit facility occurred or became imminent, we may request our credit agreement lenders to provide a waiver. If we were unsuccessful in that endeavor, we could explore alternative sources of capital, whether debt or equity, which would likely be more expensive than the costs we incur under our credit facility and may not be available. If we were unable to cure an un-waived event of default under our credit facility, we would be unable to borrow additional amounts under the facility, we could be unable to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs, make acquisitions, fund share repurchases or pay dividends, and our lenders thereunder could accelerate our obligations under the agreement and foreclose on our assets subject to the liens in their favor. This circumstance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nDeterioration in the financial condition of our customers or suppliers and changes in the operations and strategies of our customers or suppliers could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. \n\nWe extend credit to our customers, generally without requiring collateral. The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer&#8217;s financial condition and payment history. We monitor credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financial statements on our customers. Deterioration in the economy, declines in consumer purchases of apparel, disruption in the apparel retail environment, or the inability of our customers to access liquidity could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of our customers. During the past several years, various retailers and other customers have experienced significant difficulties, including consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies and liquidations as well as retail shutdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The inability of retailers and other customers to overcome these difficulties may continue or even increase due to the current economic and retail market conditions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses based upon current conditions, historical trends, estimates and othe r available information, which involves judgments and uncertainties. During fiscal year 2023, customers generally paid on the credit extended to them, and we ended fiscal year 2023 with days sales outstanding at 45.8 days, down from 51.7 days at September 2022. Although our historical allowances have been materially accurate, if market conditions change additional reserves may be required. The inability to collect on sal es to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Significant changes in the financial condition of any of our suppliers or other parties with which we do business could result in disruption to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, significant changes in the retail, merchandising and/or operational strategies employed by our customers may result in decreased sales of our products to such customers and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, significant changes in the operations of any of our suppliers or other parties with which we do business could result in disruption to our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk that could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. \n\nThe debt we incur under our asset-based revolving credit facility is at variable rates of interest, which exposes us to interest rate risk. Reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates for our variable rate debt began to rise significantly in the second half of fiscal year 2022 and continued into fiscal year 2023. If interest rates continue to increase, the debt service obligations on such indebtedness will continue to increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. In addition, as a result of a recent amendment to our asset-based revolving credit facility, certain of the variable rate indebtedness extended to us uses the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. While we will continue to use SOFR, other factors may impact SOFR including factors causing SOFR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating SOFR to be established, or the use of an alternative reference rate(s). These consequences are not entirely predictable and could have an adverse impact on our financing costs, returns on investments, valuation of derivative contracts and our financial results.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may need to raise additional capital to grow our business. \n\nThe rate of our growth, especially through acquisitions, depends, in part, on the availability of debt and equity capital. We may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we may be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and/or grow the business.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may be subject to the impairment of acquired intangible assets. \n\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. At September 2023 and September 2022, our goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $50.4 million and $61.9 million, respectively. We conduct an annual review, and more frequent reviews if events or circumstances dictate, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We also determine whether impairment indicators are present related to our identifiable intangible assets. If we determine that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets. We completed our annual impairment test of goodwill on the first day of our third fiscal quarter and concluded that there was no indication of impairment. However, based upon the operating results and projections for our DTG2Go business, during our fourth fiscal quarter we concluded that the goodwill associated with that business was impaired. Due to this impairment, we recorded an impairment charge of $9.2 million in fiscal year 2023. \n\n&#160;\n\nAt September 2023 , we concluded based on the assessment performed that there was no additional indication of impairment on the goodwill to be recorded on our financial statements. We also concluded that there are no additional indicators of impairment related to our intangible assets. There can, however, be no assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nWe manufacture the majority of our products outside of the United States, exposing us to currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source products from various countries. We may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, but our efforts may not be successful. Accordingly, changes in the relative strength of the United States dollar against other currencies could adversely affect our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe market price of our shares is affected by the illiquidity of our shares, which could lead to our shares trading at prices that are significantly lower than expected. \n\nVarious investment banking firms have informed us that public companies with relatively small market capitalizations have difficulty generating institutional interest, research coverage, and trading volume. This illiquidity can translate into price discounts as compared to industry peers or to the shares&#8217; inherent value. We believe that the market perceives us to have a relatively small market capitalization. This has led and could continue to lead to our shares trading at prices that are significantly lower than our estimate of their inherent value.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of November 30, 2023, we had 7,001,020 shares of common stock outstanding. We believe that approximately 51% of our stock is beneficially owned by entities and individuals who each own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Institutional investors that each beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares collectively own approximately 39% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by any of these large holders could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, especially in light of the limited trading volumes. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe market price of our shares may be highly volatile, and the stock market in general can be highly volatile. \n\nFluctuations in our stock price may be influenced by, among other things, general economic and market conditions, conditions or trends in our industry, changes in the market valuations of other apparel companies, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or other strategic initiatives, and trading volumes. Many of these factors are beyond our control but may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our operating performance.\n\n&#160;\n\n", "item_7": " Item 7. Management &#8217; s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of Delta Apparel&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements. Financial measures included herein have been presented on a generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) basis. In the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, certain financial measures may be considered &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; under SEC rules. These rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. \n\n&#160;\n\nBusiness Outlook \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we were able to work through most of the trailing expense impacts of our curtailed production levels and last year&#8217;s historically high-priced cotton flowing through our cost of sales. Our Activewear business, which houses our nearshore manufacturing platform and serves the channels hit hardest by the much-publicized over-inventoried retail environment in 2023, was the most directly impacted by these unique cost-driving events. Now that we are inputting lower cotton cost in our inventory and running our manufacturing facilities at more consistent levels closer to capacity, we believe our Activewear business is well-positioned to take advantage of market improvements and see more indications that the elevated inventory levels in the retail supply chain following heavy buying activity in 2022 may be moderating. We continue to make steady progress towards a more normalized operating environment for our overall business, with our decision last year to reduce production levels to align with the lower demand environment and purchase less price-inflated cotton proving effective in positioning Delta Apparel for improved operating results going forward.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe will complete a significant strategic initiative involving the transition of our more expensive Mexico production capacity into our lower-cost Central American platform in the next few months. This initiative, along with several other restructuring activities completed in 2023, should generate annual cost savings of up to $6 million and position our Company to generate better returns on the capital we invest in our business in the current higher interest rate environment. In addition, we made substantial progress on inventory and debt reduction initiatives intended to counteract the challenging operating environment seen in recent periods, including an approximately 16% reduction in inventory from our most recent high in December 2022 and an approximately 17% reduction in long-term debt from our most recent high in February 2023. We expect further inventory and debt reductions as we move through fiscal year 2024 and plan to continue to tightly manage our spending and reduce capital expenditures year-over-year.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Delta Group segment&#8217;s fully integrated Activewear and DTG2Go businesses continue to offer solutions to a broadening spectrum of customers across the apparel industry. The two largest channels in Activewear&#8217;s Delta Direct business, Retail License and Regional Screenprint, showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter and to start the new fiscal year, while Delta Direct&#8217;s eRetail and promotional channels continue to strengthen. We expect Activewear&#8217;s Global Brands and Retail Direct businesses to steadily pick up as we move into the second half of this fiscal year and get past some of the current headwinds from lower demand and excess global manufacturing capacity. Our onshore and nearshore manufacturing and fulfillment platforms, coupled with a distribution network spanning the United States, continue to become more integral to brand and retailer sourcing strategies and generate interest from customers looking to reach the United States market more efficiently and manage supply chain risks associated with international trade policy, ESG priorities, inflationary pressures, and supply chain disruptions.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur DTG2Go business recently achieved a variety of key milestones including the recalibration of our entire &#8220;Digital First&#8221; technology fleet and the launch of a proprietary online portal geared towards quick reaction programs not suited for traditional decoration platforms. We also advanced several significant research and development initiatives including a proprietary fabric optimized for digital printing that should accelerate customer usage of Delta Direct blank garments at DTG2Go and a proprietary textile manufacturing process designed to solve well-known quality challenges arising during digital printing. The gains flowing from these initiatives should provide a solid foundation for improved operating results and sales growth at DTG2Go going forward. We believe that DTG2Go is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing digital disruption in the decorated apparel market through its industry-leading print capacity, nationwide fulfillment network, proprietary technology and processes, and vertical blank supply through Delta Direct.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Salt Life business generated significant operating profitability in fiscal year 2023 despite some temporary softness in its wholesale channel stemming from higher inventory levels at retail. We expect a return to sales growth at Salt Life going forward, including more direct-to-consumer growth in both the branded retail and eCommerce channels. Salt Life continues to expand its branded retail footprint with the recent opening of two new retail doors in Florida and the brand&#8217;s first location in Virginia set to open in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. It will finish the calendar year with six new retail stores and a total owned retail footprint comprising 27 stores, including 15 full-price stores and 12 outlet stores across the country and over 55,000 square feet of retail floor space.\n\n&#160;\n\nSalt Life&#8217;s ecommerce website sales continue to outperform and grew 52% for the year. We believe there is ample room for more growth in the ecommerce channel as we develop more data analytics and targeted marketing strategies. We were also pleased to see the initial market interest in Salt Life&#8217;s newly licensed home furnishings line exceed expectations and expect Salt Life&#8217;s license royalty revenue stream to more than double this fiscal year as the new line sells through. We continue to invest in marketing initiatives designed to elevate the Salt Life brand and drive increased engagement. Salt Life&#8217;s YouTube channel, www.youtube.com/@saltlife , currently has over 53 million total views and over 125,000 subscribers. In addition, Salt Life&#8217;s social media audience spanning Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and Pinterest continues to grow, and Salt Life continues to interact with consumers through its online content portal, The Daily Salt, and its Salt Life-branded podcast, Above and Below.\n\n&#160;\n\nWith two very significant cost-driving trends now moving behind us and a streamlined cost structure in place moving ahead, Delta Apparel is in excellent position to take advantage of favorable changes in demand as they arise across our five go-to-market channels. We expect to see steady improvement in our overall operating results in fiscal year 2024 and will remain keenly focused on growth, profitability, and above all, creating value for shareholders for many years to come.\n\n&#160;\n\nResults of Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nNet sales for 2023 were $415.4 million, a decline of 14.3% from $484.9 million in the prior year when the apparel industry was a &#8220;seller&#8217;s market&#8221; with retailers and their suppliers accumulating inventory amid the rebound from COVID-related supply chain delays.\n\n&#160;\n\nDelta Group segment net sales decreased 16.1% to $356.3 million in 2023 compared to prior year net sales of $424.8 million. Within the Activewear business, our Delta Direct, Global Brands and Retail Direct channels all experienced double-digit year-over-year declines as customers right-sized inventory levels from fiscal year 2022. The Activewear business was heavily impacted by the over-inventoried environment in the retail and other supply chains following the notable buying activity in fiscal year 2022 due to economic conditions, supply-chain constraints, and product availability.\n\n&#160;\n\nSalt Life Group segment net sales were $59.0 million in 2023, a decrease of 1.7% from $60.1 million in the prior year. During fiscal year 2023, the segment saw growth in its direct-to-consumer sales through retail stores and ecommerce channels offset by a decline in the wholesale channel. Salt Life opened four new branded retail doors during the fiscal year, bringing our total retail store locations to 25 as of fiscal year end. Salt Life has since opened two additional retail stores and plans to open another location in second quarter of fiscal year 2024, bringing its total branded retail stores to 28.\n\n&#160;\n\nGross margins were 13.0% for fiscal year 2023, a decline from 22.4% in fiscal year 2022 driven by production curtailments to match manufacturing output with market demand as well as inflationary cotton costs (collectively \"Production Curtailment &#38; Cotton Costs\"). Excluding these Production Curtailment &#38; Cotton Costs, fiscal year 2023 adjusted gross margins were 21.2%. \n\n&#160;\n\nDelta Group segment gross margins were 6.1% for fiscal year 2023, a decrease of 1,220 basis points from gross margins of 18.3% in fiscal year 2022. Excluding the Production Curtailment &#38; Cotton Costs, adjusted gross margins were 15.6% for fiscal year 2023. \n\n&#160;\n\nSalt Life Group segment gross margins were 54.6% in fiscal year 2023, an improvement of 300 basis points compared to 51.6% in fiscal year 2022 resulting from a favorable mix of sales, including increased Salt Life branded retail store sales, which offset a decline in wholesale sales from recent market softness. \n\n&#160;\n\nSelling, general and administrative (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) expenses in fiscal year 2023 were $73.7 million, or 17.8% of sales, compared to $79.5 million, or 16.4% of sales, in 2022. SG&#38;A expenses decreased in 2023 due to lower wages and wage-related expenses, offset by an increase in expenses due to costs associated with the expansion of Salt Life&#8217;s retail store footprint.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther expense of $9.7 million in 2023 includes $9.2 million in goodwill impairment charges, $1.0 million in other impairment charges and $0.6 million severance charges, offset by $1.0 million in profits related to our equity investment in Green Valley Industrial Park, S.A. de C.V., the Honduran entity that owns and operates the industrial park in Naco, Quimistan, Santa Barbara Honduras, where our Ceiba Textiles facility is located (&#8220;Honduran Equity Method Investment&#8221;). The other impairment charges stem from the closure of our legacy single-purpose DTG2Go facility in Clearwater, Florida and shift of its' digital production capacity into our national footprint of dual-purpose facilities housing digital printing and blank garment distribution under one roof, as well as long-lived asset impairment of our Mexico facilities in connection with their closure. Severance charges related to expected employee severance at our Mexico facilities. In the prior year, other income of $2.4 million included $0.9 million in profits related to the Honduran Equity Method Investment, as well as $1.9 million in income from the net reduction in contingent consideration liabilities, offset by a loss on the disposal of fixed assets of $0.4 million.\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating loss for fiscal year 2023 was $29.4 million. Excluding the Production Curtailment, Cotton Costs, Restructuring Costs and Goodwill Impairment Charges, fiscal year 2023 adjusted operating income was $9.2 million, or 2.2% of net sales. This compares to operating income of $31.8 million in the prior year.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Delta Group segment experienced an operating loss of $26.2 million in fiscal year 2023, or (7.3%) of Delta Group net sales, compared to operating profit of $38.0 million, or 9.0% of Delta Group net sales, in fiscal year 2022. Excluding the Production Curtailment, Cotton Costs, Restructuring Costs and Goodwill Impairment Charges fiscal year 2023 Delta Group segment adjusted operating income was $21.7 million, or 6.1% of Delta Group net sales. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Salt Life Group segment achieved operating income of $6.2 million in fiscal year 2023, or 10.4% of Salt Life Group net sales, compared to $8.2 million, or 13.6% of Salt Life Group net sales, in fiscal year 2022. The lower operating income was driven by lower sales volume, accompanied by a favorable product sales mix and increased selling costs partially offset by increased gross margins as a percentage of sales. \n\n&#160;\n\nNet interest expense for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was $14.2 million and $7.7 million, respectively. The increases in interest expense over the prior year periods is primarily due to increased interest rates. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur effective tax rate on operations for fiscal year 2023 is 23.8%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 17.9% for fiscal year 2022. Changes in the mix of U.S. taxable income compared to profits in tax-free or lower-tax jurisdictions drove this change in our effective tax rate. See Note 9&#8212;Income T axes for more information.\n\n&#160;\n\nNet loss attributable to shareholders for fiscal year 2023 was $33.2 million, or $4.75 per share, compared to net income of $19.7 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2022. Excluding the Production Curtailment, Cotton Costs, Restructuring Costs and Goodwill Impairment Charges fiscal year 2023 adjusted net income was $3.3 million, or $0.47 per share. \n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts receivable was $45.1 million on September 2023, as compared to $68.2 million as of September 2022. Days sales outstanding ( &#8220; DSO &#8221; ) as of September 2023 were 46 days compared to 52 days at September 2022. \n\n&#160;\n\nNet inventory as of September 2023 was $212.4 million, a decrease of $36.2 million from September 2022. The reductions in inventory reflects the Company &#8217; s success with initiatives to right-size inventories and counteract the challenging operating environment going forward. In addition, t he inventory value is lower than the prior fiscal year end as a result of lower input costs impacting materials, transportation and labor combined with a decrease in units on hand. \n\n&#160;\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\n&#160;\n\nWe provide all information required in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only U.S. GAAP financial measures. In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results, we also provide non-GAAP information that management believes is useful to investors. We discuss gross margins, operating income and net income performance measures that are, for comparison purposes, adjusted to eliminate items or results stemming from discrete events. We do this because management uses these measures in evaluating our underlying performance on a consistent basis across periods. We also believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our ongoing performance. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and securities analysts, investors and other interested parties should not consider any of these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis or our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.

As such, Cotton Costs consist of the cotton component of the Company's cost of sales in excess of $0.93 per pound.\n\n&#160;\n\n(3) &#160; Restructuring Costs consist of employee severance benefits paid in connection with the transition of our more expensive Mexico manufacturing capacity to our more efficient Central America manufacturing platform, employee severance benefits paid in connection with leadership restructuring, expenses incurred in connection with the closure of a legacy facility we acquired via acquisition and the absorption of the print capacity at that facility into our nationwide network of dual purpose digital print and blank garment distribution facilities, and additional cost items incurred from restructuring activities.\n\n&#160;\n\n(4) Goodwill Impairment Charges consists of a non-cash charge associated with our DTG2Go business.\n\n&#160;\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have funded our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions and investments, restructuring activities, and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment removed from service, if any. See Note 8 - Long-Term Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information regarding our debt.\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating Cash Flows \n\n&#160;\n\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2023 was $11.2 million, compared to cash used by operating activities of $20.1 million in fiscal year 2022. The increase in operating cash flows in 2023 primarily relate to increasing accounts receivable collection and a decline in inventory compared to the prior year build from increased input costs and manufacturing output. This was partially offset by decreased earnings in the business and change in the timing of payments to suppliers in the current period.\n\n&#160;\n\nInvesting Cash Flows \n\n&#160;\n\nCash provided by investing activities in fiscal year 2023 was $1.6 million and cash used in investing activities was $13.0 million in fiscal year 2022 . Capital expenditures during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were $5.5 and $19.9 million, respectively. Capital expenditures in both periods primarily related to investments in our distribution expansion, digital print equipment, information technology, and retail stores. There were $2.3 million in expenditures financed under capital lease arrangements and $1.3 million in unpaid expenditures as of September 2023 . \n\n&#160;\n\nWe currently expect to spend less on capital expenditures in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023, with these expenditures focused on information technology, manufacturing efficiency, and direct-to-consumer investments, including new Salt Life retail store openings. \n\n&#160;\n\nFinancing Activities \n\n&#160;\n\nCash used by financing activities was $13.0 million in fiscal year 2023 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $24.1 million in fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2023, we concentrated on the reduction of debt. In fiscal year 2022, we increased the amount outstanding on our U.S credit facility and utilized cash proceeds to fund operating activities and certain capital investments, as well as the required payments on our capital lease financing. Additionally, in fiscal year 2022, we entered into a new Honduran term loan with a principal of $3.7 million and a new term loan related to our El Salvador operations for $3.0 million, both with five-year terms. In fiscal year 2023, there were no share repurchases. In fiscal year 2022, we repurchased $4.0 million in shares of our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nFuture Liquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\nSee Note 8 &#8211; Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our various financing arrangements, including the terms of our revolving U.S. credit facility. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur asset-based U.S. revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations are intended to fund our day-to-day working capital needs and, along with capital lease financing arrangements, to fund our planned capital expenditures. However, any material deterioration in our results of operations may result in the loss of our ability to borrow under our U.S. revolving credit facility and to issue letters of credit to suppliers or may cause the borrowing availability under that facility to be insufficient for our needs. Availability under our credit facility is primarily a function of the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory. A significant deterioration in our accounts receivable or inventory levels could restrict our ability to borrow additional funds or service our indebtedness. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur term loan and revolving credit facility in Honduras and our term loan in El Salvador allow the Company to finance both operations and capital expenses. Each of these loans are secured by a first-priority lien on the assets of our Honduran and El Salvador operations and is not guaranteed by our U.S. entities. The Honduran revolving credit facility permits us to re-borrow funds up to the amount repaid, subject to certain objective covenants. While we intend to re-borrow funds, subject to those covenants, we have classified the explicit repayment amounts included within the loan agreement as long-term if due more than a year after September 30, 2023. \n\nDerivative Instruments \n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we may purchase cotton option contracts to economically hedge the risk related to market fluctuations in the cost of cotton used in our operations. We do not receive hedge accounting treatment for these derivatives. As such, the realized gains and losses associated with them were recorded within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. At September 2023, there were no material option agreements that were outstanding. \n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we may use interest rate swaps or other instruments to manage our interest rate exposure and reduce the impact of future interest rate changes. These financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. We have designated our interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges of our future interest payments. As a result, the gains and losses on the swap contracts are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and are reclassified into interest expense as the related interest payments are made. As of September 2023, and September 2022, all of other comprehensive (loss) income was attributable to shareholders and none related to the non-controlling interest. The changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements resulted in other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, of $0.1 million and other comprehensive gain, net of taxes, of $0.9 million for the years ended September 2023, and September 2022, respectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nOff-Bala nce Sheet Arrangements \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of September 2023 , we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that were material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC other than letters of credit and purchase obligations. We have disclosed letters of credit and purchase obligations in Note 15&#8212;Commitments and Contingencies. \n\n&#160;\n\nDividends and Purchases of our Own Shares \n\n&#160;\n\nPursuant to the terms of our credit facility, we are allowed to make cash dividends and stock repurchases if (i) as of the date of the payment or repurchase and after giving effect to the payment or repurchase, we have availability on that date of not less than 15% of the lesser of the borrowing base or the commitment, and average availability for the 30-day period immediately preceding that date of not less than 15% of the lesser of the borrowing base or the commitment; and (ii) the aggregate amount of dividends and stock repurchases after May 10, 2016, does not exceed $10 million plus 50% of our cumulative net income (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) from the first day of the third quarter of 2016 to the date of determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Amended Credit Agreement currently restricts us from making cash dividends or stock repurchases until the later of (x) November 4, 2023 and (y) the date upon which (a) our availability (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and (b) our average availability (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) for the immediately preceding 30 consecutive days, is equal to or more than the greater of (i) 17.50% of the lesser of (A) our borrowing base (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) or (B) the maximum revolver amount (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and (ii) $25,000,000 and (II) certification that (x) our FCCR is equal to or greater than 1.00:1.00 for the trailing 12-month period and (y) as of such date, no default (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) or event of default exists. For purposes of this definition, availability and average availability will be calculated (x) after giving effect to the availability block (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) and (y) without giving effect to the application of the net cash proceeds from certain sale-leaseback transactions. Absent the restrictions referenced in the preceding two sentences, at September 2023, and September 2022, there was $8.3 million and $24.9 million, respectively, of retained earnings free of restrictions to make cash dividends or stock repurchases. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur Board of Directors did not declare, nor were any dividends paid, during fiscal years 2023 and 2022 . Any future cash dividend payments will depend upon our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, compliance with loan covenants and other relevant factors. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of September 2023, our Board of Directors had authorized management to use up to $60.0 million to repurchase stock in open market transactions under our Stock Repurchase Program. During 2022, we purchased 136,181 shares of our common stock for a total cost of $4.0 million. There were no repurchases of our common stock in 2023. As of September 2023, we had purchased 3,735,114 shares of common stock for an aggregate of $56.4 million since the inception of the Stock Repurchase Program. All purchases were made at the discretion of management and pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of SEC Rule 10b-18. As of September 2023, $3.6 million remained authorized by our Board of Directors for future purchases under our Stock Repurchase Program, which does not have an expiration date. \n\n&#160;\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\n&#160;\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have no reason to believe that our past estimates have not been appropriate. Our most critical accounting estimates, discussed below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, inventories and related reserves, the carrying value of goodwill, and the accounting for income taxes.\n\n&#160;\n\nNote 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n&#160;\n\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts are satisfied. Our performance obligations primarily consist of delivering products to our customers. Control is transferred upon providing the products to customers in our retail stores, upon shipment of our products to consumers from our ecommerce sites, and upon shipment from our distribution centers to our customers in our wholesale operations. Once control is transferred to the customer, we have completed our performance obligation.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn certain areas of our wholesale business, we offer discounts and allowances to support our customers. Some of these arrangements are written agreements, while others may be implied by customary practices in the industry. Wholesale sales are recorded net of discounts, allowances, and operational chargebacks. As certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season, program or other event which may not have occurred, we estimate such discounts, allowances, and returns that we expect to provide.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. We estimate these reductions based on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. If we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination. Reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are included within accrued expenses as refund liabilities, and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 2023, and September 2022, there was $0.8 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in refund liabilities for customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts included within accrued expenses.\n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts Receivable and Related Reserves \n\n&#160;\n\nAccounts receivable consists primarily of receivables from our customers arising from the sale of our products, and we generally do not require collateral from our customers. We actively monitor our exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits. Accounts receivable is presented net of reserves for doubtful accounts.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe estimate the net collectability of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment. In situations where we are aware of a specific customer&#8217;s inability to meet its financial obligation, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing, we assess the need for a specific reserve for bad debts. Reserves are determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms. Although our historical allowances have been materially accurate, if market conditions change, additional reserves may be required. Bad debt expense was less than 1% of net sales in each of fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nInventories and Related Reserves \n\n&#160;\n\nWe state inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory cost includes materials, labor and manufacturing overhead on manufactured inventory and all direct and associated costs, including inbound freight, to acquire sourced products. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record reserves for obsolescence, excess quantities, irregulars and slow-moving inventory based on historical selling prices, current market conditions, and forecasted product demand to reduce inventory to its net realizable value. Although our historical reserves have been materially accurate, if actual selling prices are less favorable than those projected or if sell-through of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated, additional inventory reserves may be required.\n\n&#160;\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets \n\n&#160;\n\nWe recorded restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal year 2023 in the amount of $1.1 million, no charges were incurred in fiscal year 2022. The charges in fiscal year 2023 relate to $0.8 million in expense in our DTG2Go business as we shifted the digital production capacity from our legacy, single-purpose Clearwater, Florida facility into our national footprint of dual-purpose facilities housing digital printing and blank garment distribution under one roof to advance our integrated on-demand model and further leverage the distinct competitive advantages it provides DTG2Go. Additionally, $0.2 million in fixed asset impairment charges related to the Campeche, Mexico assets as we implemented strategic actions to better optimize our overall cost structure, including the transition of our more expensive production capacity in Mexico, where we have to purchase third party textile fabric to our lower cost Central American platform served by our own textile manufacturing operations. These other Central American platforms will absorb the Mexican production. This transition requires significant reductions in our offshore manufacturing workforce and associated severance benefit payments. The remaining fixed assets related to Campeche, Mexico are fully recoverable and were not impaired.\n\n&#160;\n\nGoodwill \n\n&#160;\n\nGoodwill was recorded in conjunction with our acquisitions of Salt Life, DTG2Go, and Silk Screen Ink, Ltd. d/b/a SSI Digital Print Services, (&#8220;SSI&#8221;). We did not record any separately identifiable indefinite-lived intangibles associated with any of these acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired, and goodwill is required to be written down when impaired. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually on the first day of our third fiscal quarter, or more often if events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We assess the value of our goodwill under either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, the Company evaluates various market and other factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the Company&#8217;s goodwill has been impaired. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers the carrying value of its reporting units compared to its fair value as well as events and changes in circumstances that could include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, and significant adverse changes in the price of the Company&#8217;s common stock. If such qualitative assessment indicates that impairment may have occurred, an additional quantitative assessment is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their respective estimated fair values. If the recorded carrying value of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write the reporting unit down to its estimated fair value.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s goodwill impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make significant judgments in estimating the fair value of the Company&#8217;s reporting units, including the projection of future cash flows and the selection of discount rates. These calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions such as estimating economic factors, including the profitability of future business operations. Further, the Company&#8217;s ability to realize the future cash flows used in its fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in the Company&#8217;s operating performance, and changes in the Company&#8217;s business strategies. Significant changes in any of the assumptions involved in calculating these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of the Company&#8217;s reporting units and could result in impairment charges in a future period.\n\n&#160;\n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160;\n\nWe account for income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as operating loss, interest deductions, and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is required to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. In making this final determination, we follow the Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (&#8220;ASC 740&#8221;), and look to taxable income in prior carryback years, reversals of existing temporary book/tax differences, tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversals of existing temporary differences. By its very nature, future taxable income requires estimates and judgments about future events that may be predictable but are far less certain than past events that can be objectively measured.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe established a valuation allowance related to certain of our state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. We continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective state tax jurisdictions. As of September 2023 , we had state net operating losses of approximately $79.3 million, with deferred tax assets of $4.1 million related to these state NOLs, and related valuation allowances against them of approximately $1.1 million. These state net loss carryforwards expire at various intervals from 2027 through 2040. Our deferred tax asset related to state net operating loss carryforwards is reduced by a valuation allowance to result in net deferred tax assets we consider more likely than not to be realized. \n\n&#160;\n\nRecent Accounting Standards \n\n&#160;\n\nFor information regarding recently issued accounting standards, refer to Note 2(ad) and Note 2(ae) to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n&#160;\n\n", "item_7a": " Item 7A.
