Risk Factors\n\nNot applicable, as the Company is a &#8220;smaller reporting company.&#8221;\n\n&#8203; \n\n", "item_7": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the financial statements, which appear beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Mercer Bancorp provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nOverview\n\nMercer Bancorp conducts its operations primarily through Mercer Savings Bank. The Bank&#8217;s business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and agricultural real estate loans secured by properties located in our primary market area. To a lesser extent, we also originate consumer loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and land loans, home equity lines of credit, and commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, in January 2023, we began implementing an indirect automobile lending program, in which loan applications are referred to us by car dealerships. Our management has experience with indirect automobile lending and we intend to prudently grow that segment of the loan portfolio. We intend to retain a portion of these automobile loans and also intend to sell certain of these automobile loans that we originate. We also invest in securities, which have historically consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities and obligations issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises, state and municipal securities. Following the conversion and stock offering, we intend to continue to seek to expand our residential real estate and agricultural real estate portfolios. We offer a variety of deposit accounts including checking accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Our primary source of funding is core deposits. We also utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and brokered deposits for liquidity and asset/liability management purposes, and may attempt to attract municipal deposits to a lesser extent. \n\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts, gains on sales of loans, and income from bank owned life insurance. Non-interest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to employee compensation and benefits, data processing expense, occupancy and equipment expense, check, ATM, credit card processing and network fees, director compensation and benefits, professional services fees, and other expenses. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in inflation, market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Mercer Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the ODFI and the FDIC.\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\nOur principal objective is to build long-term value for our stockholders by operating a profitable community-oriented financial institution dedicated to meeting the banking needs of our customers. Highlights of our current business strategy include:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Continue to focus on originating one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and agricultural real estate loans for retention in our loan portfolio. We are primarily a residential mortgage lender for borrowers in our primary market area. At September 30, 2023, $74.6 million, or 55.7% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of residential mortgage loans. Additionally, given the rural economy of our market area, agricultural real estate loans also comprise a significant portion of our loan portfolio. At September 30, 2023, $36.4 million, or 27.2% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of agricultural real estate loans. We have significant experience in these areas and expect that residential mortgage and agricultural real estate lending will remain our primary lending activities following the conversion and stock offering. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Grow and diversify our loan portfolio prudently by implementing an indirect automobile lending program and enhance fee income through the pooling and sale of such loans . Although we intend to continue our historical focus on the origination of residential mortgage and agricultural real estate loans, in January 2023, we began implementing an indirect automobile lending program. We originate indirect automobile loans from car dealerships located in western and southeastern Ohio and eastern Indiana. At September 30, 2023, $6.8 million, or 5.1% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of indirect automobile loans held for investment and we had an additional $3.1 million of automobile loans held for sale. We intend to prudently increase our originations of consumer automobile loans in order to diversify our loan portfolio, increase yield and manage interest rate risk. We also intend to pool and sell to investors some of ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START the automobile loans that we originate to enhance fee income. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we did not sell any indirect automobile loans. ##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; Maintain our strong asset quality through conservative loan underwriting. We intend to maintain strong asset quality through what we believe are our conservative underwriting standards and credit monitoring processes. At September 30, 2023, our nonperforming loans totaled $477,000, or 0.36% of total loans. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Continue efforts to gain deposit market share and grow our low-cost &#8220;core&#8221; deposit base. We consider our core deposits to include savings accounts, money market accounts, other savings deposits and checking accounts. Core deposits provide a stable source of funds to support loan growth at costs consistent with improving our interest rate spread and net interest margin. We will continue our efforts to increase our core deposits through customer service, products and services offered, and customer accessibility via both traditional branches and digital platforms. Core deposits totaled $90.5 million, or 73.7% of total deposits, at September 30, 2023. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; Expand our market area and access to customers through organic growth and de novo branching, while also considering opportunistic acquisitions. We intend to grow our balance sheet organically on a managed basis. In addition to organic growth, we may also consider expansion opportunities in our market area or in contiguous markets that we believe would enhance both our franchise value and stockholder returns. These opportunities may include establishing new (&#8220;de novo&#8221;) branch offices or acquiring other financial institutions or branch offices. Specifically, we intend to establish a fifth branch office during 2024 in Adams or Jay County in eastern Indiana, where we are an active lender. We believe this de novo branch will expand our access to customers and core deposits in that part of our market area. We do not currently have any understandings or agreements regarding any acquisitions. ##TABLE_END \n\n&#8203; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n&#8203; \n\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles used in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;) contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; we may delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe following represent our critical accounting policies: \n\n&#8203; \n\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed, credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies. \n\n&#8203; \n\nManagement performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe analysis has two components, specific and general allowances. The specific percentage allowance is for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan&#8217;s carrying value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allowance, which is for loans reviewed collectively, is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes historical loss percentages and qualitative factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessary for loans that are reviewed collectively. The qualitative component is critical in determining the allowance for loan losses as certain trends may indicate the need for changes to the allowance for loan losses based on factors beyond the historical loss history. Not incorporating a qualitative component could misstate the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material negative effect on our financial results. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans decreased from 0.81% at September 30, 2022 to 0.70% at September 30, 2023, due primarily to $49,000 in net charge-offs in 2023. Management&#8217;s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses primarily reflects the impact of the growth in certain segments of our loan portfolio, as well as our consideration of the economic conditions affecting the qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses as they evolved over that period from the impact of inflationary pressures and economic conditions, among other considerations. From September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2023, changes to qualitative factors to reflect slowing \n\ngrowth trends in certain portfolio segments resulted in an increase in the amount allocated for residential mortgages and construction mortgages of $115,000 and $15,000, respectively. Increased risk related to trends in the levels of delinquencies for the same period only partially offset changes related to portfolio production. \n\n&#8203; \n\nA new credit loss accounting standard, the Current Expected Credit Loss standard (&#8220;CECL&#8221;), became effective for Mercer Savings Bank on October 1, 2023. CECL requires the determination of periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are incurred or probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and will require us to greatly increase the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. The Company has finalized the methodology determination, software models, quantitative framework, and policies and procedures for how to determine expected credit losses under the new guidance. Management is finalizing the qualitative component of CECL calculation, reviewing internal procedures, policies, and assumptions. \n\nDeferred Tax Assets. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Determining the proper valuation allowance for deferred taxes is critical in properly valuing the deferred tax asset and the related recognition of income tax expense or benefit. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. \n\n&#8203; \n\nFair Value Measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The Bank estimates the fair value of a financial instrument and any related asset impairment using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. When observable market prices do not exist, the Bank estimates fair value. These estimates are subjective in nature and imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount of gain or loss recorded. A more detailed description of the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy and the methodology utilized by the Bank can be found in Note 12 of the Financial Statements &#8212; &#8220;Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.&#8221; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nComparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022\n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal Assets. Total assets were $159.0 million at September 30, 2023, an increase of $6.2 million, or 4.0%, from the $152.9 million at September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily comprised of an increase in loans and loans held for sale of $15.4 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $8.1 million. \n\n&#8203; \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $8.1 million, or 56.2%, to $6.3 million at September 30, 2023 from $14.4 million at September 30, 2022. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in loans and a decrease in deposits during the year ended September 30, 2023. \n\n&#8203; \n\nInvestment Securities. Investment securities available for sale and held to maturity decreased $1.2 million, or 9.4%, to $11.6 million at September 30, 2023, from $12.8 million at September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2023, securities purchases of $2.3 million were more than offset by sales, calls, maturities and repayments of $3.5 million. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe yield on investment securities was 1.91% for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to 1.02% for the year ended September 30, 2022, reflecting the recent increases in the overall interest rate environment. \n\n&#8203; \n\nLoans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale increased to $3.1 million at September 30, 2023 compared to none at September 30, 2022. During fiscal 2023, management established an indirect automobile lending program and began to originate auto loans both for sale and for investment. Loans held for sale consisted solely of automobile loans at September 30, 2023. No sales of auto loans occurred during the year ended September 30, 2023. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Loans. Net loans increased by $12.3 million, or 10.5%, to $130.0 million at September 30, 2023 from $117.7 million at September 30, 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2023, loan originations totaled $34.6 million, comprised primarily of $13.1 million secured by agricultural real estate, $5.1 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate and $4.9 million of construction loans. Consumer loans originated totaled $10.6 million, the majority of which were automobile loans. Management designated $3.1 million of these auto loans as held for sale and $7.5 million were held in the portfolio. \n\n&#8203; \n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, agricultural real estate loans increased $7.9 million, or 27.6%, to a total of $36.4 million at September 30, 2023, construction and land loans increased $1.5 million, or 40.8%, to $5.1 million at September 30, 2023 and consumer loans increased $6.7 million, or 726.5%, to $7.7 million at September 30, 2023, while residential real estate loans decreased $3.8 million, or 4.8%, to $74.6 million at September 30, 2023, from $78.3 million at September 30, 2022. Consumer loans increased due to the establishment of our indirect automobile lending program. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Bank&#8217;s loan growth has been achieved amid strong competition for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and agricultural mortgage loans in our market area. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe Bank&#8217;s strategy includes growing the loan portfolio, continuing to focus primarily on owner-occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans, agricultural real estate loans and indirect automobile loans. \n\n&#8203; \n\nDeposits. Deposits decreased by $11.9 million, or 8.9%, to $122.8 million at September 30, 2023 from $134.8 million at September 30, 2022. Core deposits decreased $19.0 million, or 17.3%, to $90.5 million at September 30, 2023 from $109.5 million at September 30, 2022. Certificates of deposit increased $7.1 million, or 27.9%, to $32.3 million at September 30, 2023 from $25.2 million at September 30, 2022. The increase in certificates of deposit was a result of depositors&#8217; transfer of funds from lower-yielding accounts as well as a $3.0 million increase in brokered deposits year-to-year. The decrease in core deposits was due primarily to these transfers to certificates of deposit, depositors&#8217; purchases of stock in the Company&#8217;s mutual-to-stock conversion and to a lesser extent, migration to higher rate alternatives at investment brokerages. \n\n&#8203; \n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, management continued its strategy of pursuing growth in demand accounts and other lower cost core deposits, in part by enhancing products and services offered and increased marketing. Management intends to continue its efforts to increase core deposits, with an emphasis on growth in consumer and business demand deposits. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled $12.0 million at September 30, 2023, an increase of $9.0 million, or 300.0%, over the $3.0 million balance at September 30, 2022. Proceeds from the advances were used primarily to fund deposit withdrawals. Advances totaling $11.0 million are scheduled to mature within one year from September 30, 2023. \n\n&#8203; \n\nShareholders&#8217; Equity. Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $8.7 million, or 62.1%, to $22.8 million at September 30, 2023, from $14.1 million at September 30, 2022. The increase resulted from the $7.9 million net proceeds of the stock offering completed on July 26, 2023, net income of $770,000 and a $43,000 increase to equity through the accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\n\n&#8203; \n\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended September 30, 2023 was $770,000, a decrease of $174,000, or 18.4%, compared to $944,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in noninterest expenses, which included certain expenses related to our mutual-to-stock conversion and stock offering, and a $149,000 decrease in noninterest income, which were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in net interest income, a $25,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $13,000 decrease in income taxes. \n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $1.4 million, or 23.5%, to $6.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was attributable to a $1.1 million, or 19.6%, increase in interest on loans receivable, a $144,000, or 54.5%, increase in interest on investment securities and a $210,000, or 57.9%, increase in interest on interest-bearing deposits and other assets. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe average balance of loans during the year ended September 30, 2023 increased by $5.2 million, or 4.6%, from the balance for the year ended September 30, 2022, while the average yield on loans increased by 72 basis points to 4.49% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 3.77% for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in average yield on loans reflects the increase in the overall interest rate environment year to year. As interest rates began to increase during the Bank&#8217;s fiscal 2022 year, the interest rates on the Bank&#8217;s adjustable-rate loans have adjusted upward and should continue to rise provided the higher interest rate environment persists. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe average balance of investment securities increased $2.1 million to $13.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $11.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, while the average yield on investment securities increased by 89 basis points to 1.91% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 1.02% for the year ended September 30, 2022. \n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest income on other interest-bearing deposits, comprised primarily of certificates of deposit in other financial institutions, overnight deposits and stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, increased $210,000, or 57.9%, for the year ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase in the average yield of 344 basis points, to 4.19% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 0.75% for the year ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of $11.6 million. The increase in average yield was due to the increase in interest rates in the overall economy during the periods. \n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $335,000, or 55.8%, to $600,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $265,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Interest expense on deposits increased $253,000, or 52.0%, due primarily to an increase of 23 basis points in the average cost of deposits to 0.43% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 0.20% for the year ended September 30, 2022, which was partially offset by a decrease of $5.7 million, or 4.8%, in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $112.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $118.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. \n\n&#8203; \n\nInterest expense on borrowings increased $82,000, or 71.8%, for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due to a 166 basis point increase in the weighted-average rate, to 2.58% for the year ended September 30, 2023 and a $1.0 million increase in the average balance outstanding, to $4.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $3.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $1.1 million, or 19.9%, to $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase reflected an increase in the interest rate spread to 3.71% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 2.92% for the year ended September 30, 2022, while the average net interest earning assets increased $365,000 year to year. Our net interest margin increased to 3.80% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 2.95% for the year ended September 30, 2022. The interest rate spread and net interest margin were impacted by a series of interest rate increases in the economy during 2023 and 2022. \n\n&#8203; \n\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on an analysis of the factors described in &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8212;Allowance for Loan Losses,&#8221; management determined that a provision for loan losses was not required for the year ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a decrease of $25,000 from the provision recorded for the year ended September 30, 2022. The allowance for loan losses was $934,000 at September 30, 2023 and $984,000 at September 30, 2022 and represented 0.70% of total loans at September 30, 2023, and 0.81% of total loans at September 30, 2022. The determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses was due primarily to the low balances of nonperforming loans and delinquent loans. \n\n&#8203; \n\nTotal nonperforming loans were $477,000 at September 30, 2023, compared to $350,000 at September 30, 2022. Classified loans totaled $477,000 at September 30, 2023, compared to $350,000 at September 30, 2022, and total loans past due greater than 30 days were $1.3 million and $830,000 at those respective dates. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 195.7% at September 30, 2023 compared to 281.2% at September 30, 2022. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe allowance for loan losses reflects the estimate management believes to be appropriate to cover incurred probable losses which were inherent in the loan portfolio at September 30, 2023 and 2022. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, such estimates and assumptions could be proven incorrect in the future, and the actual amount of future provisions may exceed the amount of past provisions, and the increase in future provisions that may be required may adversely impact the Bank&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income totaled $645,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $149,000, or 23.1%, from $794,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was due primarily to a non-recurring $169,000 life insurance death benefit payout received during fiscal 2022 and a $45,000, or 561.6%, decrease in gains on sales of loans. The decrease in gains on sales of loans was due to a $2.2 million decline in volume of loans sold, attributable primarily to the increase in interest rates year to year, which had the effect of reducing origination of fixed-rate loans that the Bank sells in the secondary market. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $1.1 million, or 22.3%, to $5.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to $4.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due primarily to a $596,000 increase in charitable contributions, a $123,000, or 5.6%, increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $113,000, or 24.9%, increase in occupancy and equipment, a $101,000, or 40.4%, increase in professional services, a $74,000, or 14.0%, increase in data processing fees and a $70,000, or 19.3%, increase in other expense. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe increase in charitable contributions expense was due to the $600,000 contribution to the charitable foundation formed as part of the Company&#8217;s mutual-to-stock conversion. The contribution to the foundation was comprised of 50,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s stock and $100,000 in cash. \n\n&#8203; \n\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits was due primarily to a decline in deferred loan origination costs attributable to a decline in loan origination volume, ESOP compensation expense, and normal merit increases year-to-year. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense was due primarily to depreciation associated with new data processing hardware and software and a new phone system. The increase in data processing was due to an extensive IT network upgrade and the engagement of an independent firm for managed services as well as new software costs for accounting and reporting applications. The increase in professional services was due primarily to additional audit and related expenses required in connection with the reporting requirements of a public stock company. The increase in other expense was due primarily to management&#8217;s decision to outsource maintenance and security of the Company&#8217;s information technology functions, which had previously been handled internally. \n\n&#8203; \n\nNoninterest expense can be expected to increase because of costs associated with operating as a public company and increased compensation costs related to possible implementation of one or more stock-based benefit plans, if approved by our stockholders. \n\n&#8203; \n\nIncome Taxes. Income taxes decreased by $13,000, or 7.1%, to $180,000 for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to $193,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in the income tax provision was due primarily to a $187,000, or 16.4% decrease in pretax income. The effective tax rates were 19.0% and 17.0% for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\n&#8203; \n\nAverage Balance Sheets\n\nThe following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information at the dates and for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. Average yields include the effect of net deferred fee income, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. Average balances are calculated using monthly average balances. Non-\n\naccrual loans are included in the computation of average balances only. Average loan balances include loans held for sale.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203;

Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk is monitored by management and the board of directors. All directors participate in discussions during the regular board meetings evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, and the level of risk that is appropriate. These discussions take into consideration our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives consistent with the policy and guidelines approved by them. Additionally, we have engaged a third-party consultant to provide quarterly interest rate risk monitoring analysis, with reports delivered to the board of directors on a quarterly basis.\n\nOur asset/liability management strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, our primary source of earnings. Among the techniques we are using to manage interest rate risk are:\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; maintaining capital levels that exceed the thresholds for well-capitalized status under federal regulations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; maintaining a high level of liquidity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; growing our volume of core deposit accounts; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; managing our investment securities portfolio so as to reduce the average maturity and effective life of the portfolio; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; selling certain conforming, fixed-rate residential mortgages with longer terms upon origination, subject to market conditions and periodic review of our asset/liability management needs; and ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; continuing to diversify our loan portfolio by adding indirect automobile loans, which typically have higher yields and shorter maturities. ##TABLE_END \n\nBy following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates.\n\nWe have not engaged in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures or options. We do not anticipate entering into similar transactions in the future.\n\nEconomic Value of Equity . We compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of equity or &#8220;EVE&#8221;) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by 100, 200 and 300 basis point increments or decreases instantaneously by 100, 200 and 300 basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.\n\nThe following table sets forth, at September 30, 2023, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAt September 30, 2023 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEVE as a Percentage of Present \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nValue of Assets (3) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nEstimated Increase (Decrease) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\nIncrease \n\nChange in Interest \n\n&#8203; \n\nEstimated \n\n&#8203; \n\nin EVE \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;(Decrease) \n\nRates (basis points) (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nEVE (2) \n\n&#160; \n\nAmount \n\n&#160; \n\nPercent \n\n&#160; \n\nEVE Ratio (4) \n\n&#160;\n\n(basis points) \n\n(Dollars in thousands) \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n35,278 \n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n(11,117) \n\n&#8203; \n\n(23.96)\n\n% \n\n28.03 \n\n% \n\n(325) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n39,585 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(6,810) \n\n&#8203; \n\n(14.68)\n\n% \n\n29.65 \n\n% \n\n(163) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n42,573 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n(3,822) \n\n&#8203; \n\n(8.24)\n\n% \n\n30.36 \n\n% \n\n(92) \n\nLevel\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n46,395 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8212; \n\n&#160;\n\n31.28 \n\n% \n\n&#8212; \n\n(100) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n49,042 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n2,647 \n\n&#8203; \n\n5.71 \n\n% \n\n31.37 \n\n% \n\n(200) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n50,579 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n4,184 \n\n&#8203; \n\n9.02 \n\n% \n\n30.87 \n\n% \n\n(41) \n\n(300) \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n48,341 \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n1,946 \n\n&#8203; \n\n4.19 \n\n% \n\n28.70 \n\n% \n\n(258) \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. ##TABLE_END \n\nThe table above indicates that at September 30, 2023, we would have experienced a 14.68% decrease in EVE in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 9.02% increase in EVE in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2022, we would have experienced a 13.06% decrease in EVE in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 5.40% decrease in EVE in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates.\n\nChange in Net Interest Income. We also analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income model. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by up to 300 basis points or decreases instantaneously by up to 300 basis points, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-\n\nhundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the &#8220;Change in Interest Rates&#8221; column below.\n\nThe following table sets forth, at September 30, 2023, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income (&#8220;NII&#8221;) that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\n\n&#8203; \n\n##TABLE_START &#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\nAt September 30, 2023 \n\n&#160;\n\nChange in Interest Rates \n\n&#8203; \n\nNet Interest Income \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160; \n\n(basis points) (1) \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 1 Forecast \n\n&#160; \n\nYear 1 Change From Level \n\n&#160; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8203; \n\n$\n\n5,661 \n\n&#160;\n\n(2.11) \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,710 \n\n&#160;\n\n(1.26) \n\n%\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,739 \n\n&#160;\n\n(0.76) \n\n%\n\nLevel\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,783 \n\n&#160;\n\n&#8212; \n\n&#8203; \n\n(100)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,801 \n\n&#160;\n\n0.31 \n\n%\n\n(200)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,833 \n\n&#160;\n\n0.86 \n\n%\n\n(300)\n\n&#8203; \n\n&#160;\n\n5,846 \n\n&#160;\n\n1.08 \n\n%\n\n##TABLE_END \n\n##TABLE_START (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. ##TABLE_END \n\nThe table above indicates that at September 30, 2023, we would have experienced a 1.26% decrease in NII in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 0.86% increase in NII in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2022, we would have experienced a 1.33% decrease in NII in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 1.07% decrease in NII in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates.\n\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in EVE and NII require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For instance, the EVE and NII tables presented above assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. However, the shape of the yield curve changes constantly and the value and pricing of our assets and liabilities, including our deposits, may not closely correlate with changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE and NII tables may provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time and in the context of a particular yield curve, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on EVE and NII and will differ from actual results.\n\nEVE and NII calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, deposits and borrowings.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. At September 30, 2023, we had $12.0 million of outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. At September 30, 2023, we had the capacity to borrow $37.6 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had a cash management line of credit agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank providing for additional borrowing capacity of $10.0 million. We also have the ability to participate in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s new Bank Term Funding Program as needed.\n\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\n\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. For further information, see the statements of cash flows contained in the financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.\n\nAt September 30, 2023, Mercer Savings Bank exceeded all regulatory capital levels required to be considered &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; For further information, see Note 9 of the notes to the financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. At September 30, 2023, we had $11.9 million of outstanding commitments to originate loans, $2.6 million of which represents the balance of remaining funds to be disbursed on construction loans in process. Certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from September 30, 2023 totaled $26.6 million at September 30, 2023. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits is not retained, we may utilize Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati advances or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFor a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 of the notes to our financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nThe financial statements and related data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared according to GAAP which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution&#8217;s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\n\n&#8203; \n\n", "item_7a": " Item 7A.
