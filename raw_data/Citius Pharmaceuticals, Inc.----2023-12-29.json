{"companyName": "Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filedAt": "2023-12-29T16:05:44-05:00", "item_1a": " Item 1A. Risk Factors \n\n&#160; \n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our securities could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Our Business and our Industry \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have a history of net losses and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate revenues or, if we are able to generate revenues, achieve profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe were formed in 2007 and since our inception have incurred a net loss in each of our previous operating years. Our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to obtain marketing approval for and generate revenues from sales of our product candidates. We have been focused on product development, have not received approval for any of our product candidates, and have not generated any revenues to date. We have incurred losses in each period of our operations, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. These losses are likely to continue to adversely affect our working capital, total assets, and stockholders&#8217; equity. The process of developing our product candidates requires significant clinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials. In addition, commercialization of our product candidates will require that we obtain necessary regulatory approvals and establish sales, marketing, and manufacturing capabilities, either through internal hiring or through contractual relationships with others. We expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future as a result of anticipated increases in our research and development costs, including costs associated with conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials, and regulatory compliance activities. We incurred net losses of $32,542,912 and $33,640,646 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2023, we had stockholders&#8217; equity of $90,831,108 and an accumulated deficit of $162,231,379. Our net cash used in operating activities was $29,060,212 and $28,361,256 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability will depend on numerous factors, including success in: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; developing and testing product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; receiving regulatory approvals for our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; commercializing our product candidates that receive regulatory approval; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; manufacturing commercial quantities of our product candidates at acceptable cost levels; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; obtaining medical insurance coverage for any approved product candidate; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; establishing a favorable competitive position for any approved product candidates. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nMany of these factors will depend on circumstances beyond our control. We cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be approved by the FDA or any foreign regulatory body or obtain medical insurance coverage, that we will successfully bring any approved product to market or, if so, that we will ever become profitable. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm&#8217;s report includes an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern . &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAt September 30, 2023, we estimated that we have sufficient capital to continue our operations through August 2024. You should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders, in the event of liquidation. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has generated no operating revenue to date and has principally raised capital through the issuance of debt and equity instruments to finance its operations. However, the Company&#8217;s continued operations beyond August 2024, including its development plans for LYMPHIR (through Citius Oncology), Mino-Lok, Halo-Lido, Mino-Wrap and NoveCite, will depend on its ability to obtain regulatory approval to market LYMPHIR and/or Mino-Lok and generate substantial revenue from the sale of LYMPHIR and/or Mino-Lok and on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as equity and/or debt financings, strategic relationships, or out-licensing of its product candidates. However, the Company can provide no assurances on the approval, commercialization, or future sales of LYMPHIR and/or Mino-Lok or that financing or strategic relationships will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient capital, find strategic partners or generate substantial revenue from the sale of LYMPHIR and/or Mino-Lok, there would be a material adverse effect on its business. Further, the Company expects in the future to incur additional expenses as it continues to develop its product candidates, including seeking regulatory approval, and protecting its intellectual property. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nDelays in the resubmission and review of our BLA for LYMPHIR or other factors could increase the cost to develop and launch LYMPHIR. \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile we believe we have sufficient funds on hand to complete the regulatory development and commercially launch LYMPHIR, delays in our anticipated submission of the BLA for LYMPHIR, issues raised by the FDA after resubmission or other factors could increase the cost to develop and launch LYMPHIR, which we expect would require us to obtain additional capital to complete those efforts. Financing might not be available on acceptable terms or at all. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe need to secure additional financing in the future to complete the development of our other current product candidates and support our operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue developing our other product candidates besides LYMPHIR. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; the rate of progress and cost of our trials and other product development and commercialization programs for our current product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the costs and timing of obtaining licenses for additional product candidates or acquiring other complementary technologies; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the timing of any regulatory approvals of any of our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the costs of establishing or contracting for sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for our product candidates; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the status, terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion, or other arrangements. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nWe will need to access the capital markets in the future for additional capital for research and development and for operations. As of the date of this report, we do not anticipate seeking additional capital until sometime in 2024. Traditionally, pharmaceutical companies have funded their research and development expenditures through raising capital in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in these markets over the past several years have severely restricted raising new capital and have affected companies&#8217; abilities to continue to expand or fund existing research and development efforts. If economic conditions continue to be uncertain or become worse, our future cost of equity or debt capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in securing additional financing, we may be required to significantly delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, downsize our general and administrative infrastructure, or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency, including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are primarily a late-stage development company with an unproven business strategy and may never achieve commercialization of our therapeutic product candidates or profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have no approved products. All of our current product candidates are in the pre-clinical or clinical stage, although we have applied for approval for LYMPHIR. We rely on third parties to conduct the research and development activities for our product candidates and our product commercialization capabilities are unproven. We, through Citius Oncology, are in the early stages of developing our sales and marketing capabilities at this time for LYMPHIR and have contracted with Innovation Partners, a large third-party commercial sales and marketing organization with an existing commercial infrastructure and product launch experience to assist in our commercial efforts related to LYMPHIR. We have no sales or marketing capabilities with respect to our other product candidates. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop such capabilities on our own or to enter into and maintain collaboration agreements on favorable terms and to select an appropriate commercialization strategy for each product candidate that we choose to pursue and that receives approval, whether on our own or in collaboration. If we are not successful in implementing our strategy to commercialize our product candidates, we may never achieve, maintain, or increase profitability. Our ability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates will depend, among other things, on our ability to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; receive marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities for our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; establish commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers for our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; produce, through a validated process, sufficiently large quantities of our drug compound(s) to permit successful commercialization of our product candidates; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; build and maintain strong sales, distribution, and marketing capabilities sufficient to launch commercial sales of any approved products or establish collaborations with third parties for such commercialization; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; secure acceptance of any approved products from physicians, health care payers, patients, and the medical community; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, regulatory applications and development and commercialization activities. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThere are no guarantees that we will be successful in completing these tasks. If we are unable to successfully complete these tasks, we may not be able to commercialize any of our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, in which case we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain and grow our business. If we experience unanticipated delays or problems, our development costs could substantially increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have two late-stage stage product candidates while our other product candidates are clinical stage. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates and we, as a company, have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the approval or successful commercialization of any product candidates. While various members of our executive management and key employees have significant prior experience in pharmaceutical development, as a company we have to date successfully completed only one late-stage clinical trial (much of which had been undertaken by Eisai prior to our in-licensing of the intellectual property of LYMPHIR) and are just beginning to undertake commercialization activities, in each case for LYMPHIR (through Citius Oncology). Despite our progress with LYMPHIR, our operations have been limited primarily to business planning, acquiring our proprietary technology, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, and raising capital. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may choose not to continue developing any of our product candidates at any time during development, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\nAt any time, we may decide to discontinue the development of any of our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including inadequate financial resources, the appearance of new technologies that render our product candidates obsolete, competition from a competing product or changes in or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will not receive any return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to allocate those resources to potentially more productive uses. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs an example, on July 1, 2016, we announced that we were discontinuing the development of Suprenza, which was our first commercial product candidate, for strategic reasons and not due to safety or regulatory concerns, in order to focus our management and cash resources on the Phase 3 development of Mino-Lok and the Phase 2b development of Halo-Lido. The resources expended on Suprenza therefore did not provide us any benefit. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nWe face significant risks in our product candidate development efforts. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business depends on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the U.S. until we receive approval from the FDA, or in any foreign jurisdiction until we receive the requisite approvals from such jurisdiction. The process of developing new drugs and/or therapeutic products is inherently complex, unpredictable, time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our development programs will result in products that will receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance. Product candidates that appear to be promising at some or all stages of development may not receive approval or reach the market for a number of reasons that may not be predictable based on results and data of the clinical program. Product candidates may be found ineffective or may cause harmful side effects during clinical trials, may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated, may not be able to achieve the pre-defined clinical endpoints due to statistical anomalies even though clinical benefit may have been achieved, may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals, may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality, or may fail to achieve market acceptance. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe cannot predict whether or when we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates that are under development and we cannot, therefore, predict the timing of any future revenues from these product candidates, if any. As an example, in response to the submission of our BLA for LYMPHIR, the FDA issued a complete response letter (&#8220;CRL&#8221;) on July 28, 2023. The FDA is requiring us to incorporate enhanced product testing and additional controls agreed to with the FDA during the market application review. There were no concerns relating to the safety and efficacy clinical data package submitted with the BLA, or the proposed prescribing information. In September 2023, we announced that the FDA has agreed with our plans to address the requirements outlined in the CRL, which guidance has provided us with a path for completing the necessary activities to support the resubmission of the BLA for LYMPHIR. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. For example, the FDA: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; may not find the data from clinical trials, including from our Phase 3 trial for LYMPHIR, sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or BLA or to obtain marketing approval in the U.S., including any findings that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidates outweigh their safety risks; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; could determine that the information provided by us was inadequate, contained clinical deficiencies or otherwise failed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for any indication; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; may disagree with our trial design or our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials, or may change the requirements for approval even after it has reviewed and commented on the design for our trials; \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; could determine that we cannot rely on Section 505(b)(2) for Mino-Lok or Halo-Lido or any future product candidate whose composition includes components previously approved by the FDA; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; may determine that we have identified the wrong reference listed drug or drugs or that approval of a Section 505(b)(2) application for any of our product candidates is blocked by patent or non-patent exclusivity of the reference listed drug or drugs; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into agreements for the manufacture of our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; may approve our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-approval clinical trials; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations that could adversely impact our product candidate development programs; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; may not approve the labeling claims that we believe are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates, or may require labeling claims that impair the potential market acceptance of our product candidates. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nThese same risks are generally applicable to the regulatory process in foreign countries. Any failure to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates would significantly limit our ability to generate revenues, and any failure to obtain such approval for all of the indications and labeling claims we deem desirable could reduce our potential revenues. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe, through Citius Oncology, may be required to make milestone payments to the licensor and former licensee of the LYMPHIR intellectual property in connection with its development and commercialization of LYMPHIR, which could adversely affect the profitability of LYMPHIR, if approved. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnder the terms of the License Agreement with Eisai, we, through Citius Oncology, are required to pay Eisai a $6 million development milestone payment upon initial approval by the FDA of LYMPHIR for the CTCL indication (which increases to $7 million in the event Citius Oncology exercises the option to add India to the licensed territory prior to FDA approval) and an aggregate of up to $22 million related to the achievement of net product sales thresholds. Under the terms of the agreement with Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, Citius Oncology is obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $40 million related to CTCL approvals in the U.S. and other markets, up to $70 million in development milestones for additional indications, and up to $300 million for commercial sales milestones. Further, under the agreement with Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, Citius Oncology is required to (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to make commercially available products in the CTCL indication, peripheral T-cell lymphoma indication and immuno-oncology indication, (ii) initiate two investigator initiated immuno-oncology trials, (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve each of the approval milestones, and (iv) complete each specified immuno-oncology investigator trial on or before September 1, 2025, the four-year anniversary of the effective date of the definitive agreement. Additionally, Citius Oncology is required to commercially launch a product in a territory within six months of receiving regulatory approval for such product in each such jurisdiction. \n\n&#160; \n\nThese development and milestone obligations could impose substantial additional costs on us, divert resources from other aspects of the business, and adversely affect the overall profitability of LYMPHIR, if approved. We, through Citius Oncology, may need to obtain additional financing to satisfy these milestone payments, and cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, or at all. \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile our business strategy generally is to focus on the development of late-stage product candidates to lessen the development risk, there is still significant risk to successfully developing a product candidate. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur goal in generally pursuing late-stage therapeutic product candidates with what we believe is a promising pre-clinical and early clinical stage track record is to avoid the risk of failure at the pre-clinical and early clinical stages. However, there is still significant risk to obtaining regulatory approval and successfully commercializing any late-stage product candidate that we pursue. All of the risks inherent in drug development of initial stage product candidates also apply to late-stage candidates. We cannot assure you that our business strategy will be successful. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe results of pre-clinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current product candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials. \n\n&#160; \n\nPre-clinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a product candidate in the general population, but rather to test initial safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, to study limited efficacy in a small number of study patients in a selected disease population, and to identify and attempt to understand the product candidate&#8217;s side effects at various doses and dosing schedules. Success in pre-clinical studies or completed clinical trials does not ensure that later studies or trials, including continuing pre-clinical studies and large-scale clinical trials, will be successful nor does it predict future results. Favorable results in early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials, and product candidates in later stage trials may fail to show acceptable safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier trials. In addition, the placebo rate in larger studies may be higher than expected. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may be required to demonstrate through large, long-term outcome trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a broad population prior to obtaining regulatory approval. This would increase the duration and cost of any such trial. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. In addition, certain subjects in our clinical trials may respond positively to placebo treatment - these subjects are commonly known as &#8220;placebo responders&#8221; - making it more difficult to demonstrate efficacy of the trial drug compared to placebo. This effect is likely to be observed in the treatment of hemorrhoids, which could negatively impact the development program for Halo-Lido. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, we will experience potentially significant delays and cost increases in, or may decide to abandon development of, that product candidate. If we abandon or are delayed, or experience increased costs, in our development efforts related to any of our product candidates, we may not have sufficient resources to continue or complete development of that product candidate or any other product candidates. We may not be able to continue our operations and clinical studies, or generate any revenue or become profitable. Our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged. Further, it might not be possible for us to raise funds in the public or private markets, and our stock price would likely decrease significantly. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf the planned Business Combination is not completed, our common stock could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf the planned Business Combination is not completed for whatever reason, the price of our common stock could be adversely impacted if investors view the Business Combination as providing more value to both Citius Pharma and Citius Oncology on a standalone basis. Further, depending on the reason for an inability to complete the Business Combination, our business reputation could be impaired. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nIf we are unable to file for approval of Mino-Lok or Halo-Lido under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or if we are required to generate additional data related to safety and efficacy in order to obtain approval of Mino-Lok or Halo-Lido under Section 505(b)(2), we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur current plans for filing NDAs or BLAs for our product candidates include efforts to minimize the data we will be required to generate in order to obtain marketing approval for certain of our product candidates and therefore possibly reduce the time and cost of development of a product candidate and obtain a shortened review period for the application. The timeline for filing and review of our planned NDA for each of Mino-Lok and Halo-Lido is based upon our plan to submit each such NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, wherein we will rely in part on data generated by third parties and that is in the public domain or elsewhere. Depending on the data that may be required by the FDA for approval, some of the data may be related to products already approved by the FDA. If the data relied upon is related to products already approved by the FDA and covered by third-party patents, we would be required to certify that we do not infringe the listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable. As a result of the certification, the third party would have 45 days from notification of our certification to initiate an action against us. In the event that an action is brought in response to such a certification, the approval of our NDA could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months or more while we defend against such a suit. Approval of any product candidate under Section 505(b)(2) may therefore be delayed until patent exclusivity expires or until we successfully challenge the applicability of those patents applicable to our product candidates. Alternatively, we may elect to generate sufficient additional clinical data so that we no longer rely on data which triggers a potential stay of the approval of any product candidate. Even if no exclusivity periods apply to an application under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA has broad discretion to require us to generate additional data on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates to supplement third-party data on which we may be permitted to rely. In either event, we could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for such product candidate, to conduct substantial new research and development activities beyond those in which we currently plan to engage in order to obtain approval of that product candidate. Such additional new research and development activities would be costly and time consuming. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may not be able to obtain shortened review of our applications where available, and in any event the FDA may not agree that any of our product candidates qualify for marketing approval. If we are required to generate additional data to support approval, we may be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines, may be unable to generate the additional data at a reasonable cost, or at all, and may be unable to obtain marketing approval of that product candidate. In addition, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA&#8217;s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) application that we submit. \n\n&#160; \n\nTwo of our product candidates, Mino-Lok and Halo-Lido, are combination products consisting of components that have each been separately approved by the FDA for other indications and which are commercially available and marketed by other companies. Our approval under Section 505(b)(2), if received, would not preclude physicians, pharmacists, and patients from obtaining individual drug products and titrating the dosage of these drug products as close to our approved dose as possible. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Mino-Lok solution contains minocycline, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edetate), and ethyl alcohol, all of which have been separately approved by the FDA for other indications or are used as excipients in other parenteral products. Assuming FDA approval as a branded pharmaceutical product, we would need to obtain hospital formulary acceptance to generate sales of Mino-Lok. Additionally, we may encounter reluctance by the infectious disease physician community to vary from the existing standard of care to remove and replace an infected catheter. Currently, hospitals are reimbursed for the treatment of CRBSIs by the Center for Medicare and Medicare Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) through a Diagnosis Related Group (&#8220;DRG&#8221;) classification or code. Commercial insurance plans reimburse for CRBSIs in a similar manner. With Mino-Lok being priced as a branded FDA-approved pharmaceutical product, this could result in the participating hospital retaining a lower share of CMS or commercial reimbursement which may impact the acceptance and use of Mino-Lok by these institutions. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nOur Halo-Lido product candidate for the treatment of hemorrhoids is a combination product consisting of two drugs, halobetasol propionate, a corticosteroid, and lidocaine, that have each been separately approved by the FDA for other indications and which are commercially available and marketed by other companies. Halobetasol propionate cream is available in a 0.05% strength, and lidocaine creams are also available in strengths up to 5%. From our market analysis and discussions with a limited number of physicians, we know that patients sometimes obtain two separate cream products and co-administer them as prescribed, giving them a combination treatment that could be very similar to what we intend to study and seek approval for. As a branded, FDA-approved product with safety and efficacy data, we intend to price our product substantially higher than the generically available individual creams. We will then have to convince third-party payers and pharmacy benefit managers of the advantages of our product and justify our premium pricing. We may encounter resistance from these entities and will then be dependent on patients&#8217; willingness to pay the premium and not seek alternatives. In addition, pharmacists often suggest lower cost prescription treatment alternatives to both physicians and patients. If approved, our Section 505(b)(2) approval and the market exclusivity we may receive will not guarantee that such alternatives will not exist, that substitution will not occur, or that there will be immediate or any acceptance to our pricing by payer formularies . \n\n&#160; \n\nAny fast track designation or grant of priority review status by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, nor will it assure FDA approval of our product candidates. Additionally, our product candidates may treat indications that do not qualify for priority review vouchers. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have received fast track designation for Mino-Lok to treat and salvage infected central venous catheters in patients with CRBSIs. We may seek fast track designation for some of our other product candidates or priority review of applications for approval of our product candidates for certain indications. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for the FDA fast track designation. If a product candidate offers major advances in treatment, the FDA may designate it eligible for priority review. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant these designations, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for these designations, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant them. Even with the fast track designation for Mino-Lok and if we do receive fast track designation or priority review for any other product candidate, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation from Mino-Lok or any other product candidate to be so designated if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe do not own NoveCite, Inc. outright and will share any benefits from the development of its NoveCite product candidate with the other stockholder. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we owned 75% of the outstanding common stock of NoveCite. As a result, we will only be entitled to a portion of any benefits that flow from the development by NoveCite of its NoveCite product candidate or any other product candidates that it might develop. In the event that NoveCite issues additional equity securities in the future this would likely reduce our percentage ownership, which would further reduce the portion of any benefit that might be derived from the NoveCite drug candidate&#8217;s successful development, unless we were to increase our investment. \n\n&#160; \n\nAny FDA programs related to the development and approval of treatments for COVID-19 and its symptoms may not be available to us or actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process for NoveCite, our proposed treatment for ARDS, nor will it assure FDA approval of such a treatment. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn late April 2020, we made a pre-IND submission to the FDA for NoveCite as a treatment for ARDS. The submission was made under the FDA&#8217;s Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (&#8220;CTAP&#8221;) and we requested the FDA&#8217;s feedback to support the most expeditious pathway for clinical development of the therapy. The CTAP program is relatively new and the FDA has broad discretion in administering the CTAP program and therefore we cannot assure you what the FDA might decide and whether there would be a faster development process. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nBecause our NoveCite product candidate is based on novel technologies, it is difficult to predict the regulatory approval process and the time, the cost and our ability to successfully initiate, conduct and complete clinical development, and obtain the necessary regulatory and reimbursement approvals, required for commercialization of our NoveCite product candidate. \n\n&#160; \n\nNoveCite&#8217;s cell programming technology and platform for generating cell therapy products using allogenic mesenchymal stem cells derived from iPSCs represent novel therapeutic approaches, and to our knowledge there are currently no iPSC-derived cell products approved anywhere in the world for commercial sale. As such, it is difficult to accurately predict the type and scope of challenges that NoveCite may incur during development of its NoveCite product candidate, and it faces uncertainties associated with the preclinical and clinical development, manufacture and regulatory requirements for the initiation and conduct of clinical trials, regulatory approval, and reimbursement required for successful commercialization of its NoveCite product candidate. In addition, because NoveCite&#8217;s iPSC-derived cell product candidate is in the pre-clinical stage, NoveCite is currently assessing safety in humans and has not yet been able to assess the long-term effects of treatment. Animal models and assays may not accurately predict the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in our target patient populations, and appropriate models and assays may not exist for demonstrating the safety and purity of the NoveCite product candidate, as required by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for ongoing clinical development and regulatory approval. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacture, and regulatory requirements for approval of the NoveCite product candidate may be more expensive and take longer than for other more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates due to a lack of prior experiences on the side of both developers and regulatory agencies. Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with the pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacture, and regulatory requirements for approval of the NoveCite product candidate, NoveCite may be required to modify or change its pre-clinical and clinical development plans or its manufacturing activities and plans or be required to meet stricter regulatory requirements for approval. Any such modifications or changes could delay or prevent NoveCite&#8217;s ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize its NoveCite product candidate, which would adversely affect NoveCite&#8217;s and our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nCellular immunotherapies, and stem cell therapies and iPSC-derived cell therapies in particular, represent relatively new therapeutic areas, and the FDA has cautioned consumers about potential safety risks associated with cell therapies. To date, there are relatively few approved cell therapies. As a result, the regulatory approval process for a product candidate such as NoveCite is uncertain and may be more expensive and take longer than the approval process for product candidates based on other, better known or more extensively studied technologies and therapeutic approaches. For example, there are currently no FDA approved products with a label designation that supports the use of a product to treat and reduce the severity of ARDS in patients with COVID-19, which makes it difficult to determine the clinical endpoints and data required to support an application or regulatory approval, and the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. for our product candidate. \n\n&#160; \n\nRegulatory requirements in the U.S. governing cell therapy products have changed frequently and the FDA or other regulatory bodies may change the requirements, or identify different regulatory pathways, for approval of the NoveCite product candidate. For example, within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CBER&#8221;) restructured and created a new Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies to better align its oversight activities with FDA Centers for Drugs and Medical Devices. It is possible that over time new or different divisions may be established or be granted the responsibility for regulating cell and/or gene therapy products, including iPSC-derived cell products, such as the NoveCite product candidate. As a result, NoveCite may be required to change its regulatory strategy or to modify its applications for regulatory approval, which could delay and impair its ability to complete the pre-clinical and clinical development and manufacture of, and obtain regulatory approval for, its NoveCite product candidate. Changes in regulatory authorities and advisory groups, or any new requirements or guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require NoveCite to perform additional studies, increase its development and manufacturing costs, lead to changes in regulatory pathways, positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of the NoveCite product candidate or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As NoveCite advances its NoveCite product candidate, NoveCite will be required to consult with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and its NoveCite product candidate will likely be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee. NoveCite also must comply with applicable requirements, and if it fails to do so, it may be required to delay or discontinue development of its NoveCite product candidate. Delays or unexpected costs in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, the regulatory approval necessary to bring the NoveCite product candidate to market could impair NoveCite&#8217;s and our ability to generate sufficient product revenues to maintain our respective businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nNoveCite has assumed that the biological capabilities of iPSCs and adult-donor derived cells are likely to be comparable. If it is discovered that this assumption is incorrect, the NoveCite product candidate research and development activities could be harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nNoveCite anticipates that its research and development for its NoveCite product candidate will involve iPSCs, rather than adult-donor derived cells. With respect to iPSCs, NoveCite believes that scientists are still somewhat uncertain about the clinical utility, life span, and safety of such cells, and whether such cells differ in any clinically significant ways from adult-donor derived cells. If NoveCite discovers that iPSCs will not be useful for whatever reason for its NoveCite product candidate program, this would negatively affect NoveCite&#8217;s ability to develop a marketable product and it and we may never become profitable, which would have an adverse effect on our respective businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate, that product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community and may not generate significant revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nEven if one of our product candidates obtains regulatory approval, that product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. The indication may be limited to a subset of the population or we may implement a distribution system and patient access program that is limited. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, generally is also necessary for commercial success. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from any approved product candidate or acquired approved product will depend on a number of factors, including: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; prevalence and severity of any side effects; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; results of any post-approval studies of the product; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payers; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of government or third-party coverage; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the relative convenience and ease of administration and dosing schedule; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; strength of sales, marketing and distribution support; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; price of any future products, if approved, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators&#8217; sales and marketing strategies; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\n&#9679; the effect of current and future healthcare laws on any approved products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; patient access programs that require patients to provide certain information prior to receiving new and refill prescriptions; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; requirements for prescribing physicians to complete certain educational programs for prescribing drugs. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nIf approved, any product candidate may fail to achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenue to achieve or sustain profitability, which would harm the Company&#8217;s business. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payers on the benefits of any product candidate may require significant resources and may never be successful. \n\n&#160; \n\nEven if approved for marketing by applicable regulatory bodies, we will not be able to create a market for any of our product candidates if we fail to establish marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities, either on our own or through arrangements with third parties. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur strategy with our product candidates is to outsource to third parties all or most aspects of the product development process, as well as much of our marketing, sales, and distribution activities. In order to generate sales of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval, we must either acquire or develop an internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us. Currently, we, through Citius Oncology, are in the early stages of developing our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for LYMPHIR and have contracted with Innovation Partners, a large third-party commercial sales and marketing organization with an existing commercial infrastructure and product launch experience, to assist in our commercial efforts. We do not have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities with respect to our other product candidates. The acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure requires substantial resources, which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts. To the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies for any product candidates, our revenues will depend on the efforts of others. These efforts may not be successful. If we fail to develop sales, marketing, and distribution channels, or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties or the collaboration is terminated or is otherwise unsuccessful, we will experience delays in product launch and sales and incur increased costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf we are found to have improperly promoted any off-label use of LYMPHIR or any other product candidates, if approved, or if we are found to have improperly engaged in pre-approval promotion prior to the approval of such product candidates, Citius Pharma may become subject to significant liability. Such enforcement has become more common in the pharmaceutical industry. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as LYMPHIR and any other product candidates that might be approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product&#8217;s approved labeling. If the Company receives marketing approval for its product candidates for its proposed indications, physicians may nevertheless use its product for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, if the physicians believe in their professional medical judgment it could be used in such manner. However, if the Company is found to have promoted its product for any off-label uses, the federal government could levy civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, and seek fines against us. The FDA, Department of Justice or other regulatory authorities could also request that we enter into a consent decree or a corporate integrity agreement, or seek a permanent injunction against us under which specified promotional conduct is monitored, changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of LYMPHIR or any other product candidates that receive approval, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we might be unable to compete successfully against new entrants or established companies. \n\n&#160; \n\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and medical products industries is intense and is characterized by costly sales and marketing infrastructures, as well as extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. We are aware of several pharmaceutical companies also actively engaged in the development of therapies or products for at least some of the same conditions we are targeting. Many of these companies have substantially greater research and development capabilities as well as substantially greater marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these companies have significantly greater experience than us in undertaking pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we are researching and developing. Such developments could render our product candidates, if approved, less competitive or possibly obsolete. We are also competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency, areas in which we have no current capabilities and in which we have no experience as a company, although our executive officers do have pharmaceutical commercialization and launch experience. We, through Citius Oncology, have contracted with Innovation Partners, a large third-party commercial sales and marketing organization with an existing commercial infrastructure and product launch experience to assist in our commercial efforts for LYMPHIR. However, our prior experience and our third party arrangements might not translate into the successful development and launch of any of our product candidates. Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and similar events may also significantly increase the competition we face. In addition, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries at a rapid pace. These developments may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater as well as access to strategic partners and capital resources. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we can or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors might also develop products that are more effective, more useful and less costly than ours and might also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. In addition, our competitors might be more effective than us in commercializing their products and as a result, our business and prospects might be materially harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nPhysicians and patients might not accept and use any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained. \n\n&#160; \n\nEven if the FDA approves one of our product candidates, physicians and patients might not accept and use it. Acceptance and use of our approved product candidates will depend upon a number of factors, including: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the use of our product candidates versus the then respective standards of care for the disease or problem that we seek to address with our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; cost-effectiveness of our product candidates relative to competing products or therapies; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; availability of reimbursement for our product candidates from government or other healthcare payers; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; effective marketing and distribution efforts by us and/or our licensees and distributors, if any. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nIf any of our current product candidates are approved, we expect their sales to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and as a result, the failure of any of these product candidates to find market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if any of our product candidates that may be approved sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur ability to commercialize our product candidates, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; government and health administration authorities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; private health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; other healthcare payers. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs. Even if our product candidates are approved by the FDA, insurance coverage might not be available, and reimbursement levels might be inadequate, to cover our products. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products, once approved, market acceptance of such products could be reduced. We cannot predict whether federal or state legislation will be passed that may impact reimbursement policies nor what the impact of any such legislation would be on the healthcare industry in general or on our business specifically. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are actively engaged with CMS in order to obtain the necessary coverage to facilitate reimbursement for LYMPHIR. However, we can offer no assurance as to any reimbursement coverage. \n\n&#160; \n\nHealth administration authorities in countries other than the U.S. may not provide reimbursement for our products at rates sufficient for us to achieve profitability, or at all. Like the U.S., these countries have considered health care reform proposals and could materially alter their government-sponsored health care programs by reducing reimbursement rates. Any reduction in reimbursement rates under Medicare or foreign health care programs could negatively affect the pricing of our approved product candidates. If we are not able to charge a sufficient amount for our approved product candidates, then our margins and our profitability will be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates&#8217; commercial success. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere have been, and the Company expects there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to health care systems in the U.S. and abroad that could impact its ability to sell its products profitably. The U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. For example, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220;ACA&#8221;) was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the U.S. Healthcare reform measures like the ACA may adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the U.S. or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payors. \n\n&#160; \n\nSince its enactment, there have been ongoing efforts to modify the ACA and its implementing regulations. The Company cannot predict what healthcare reform measures may be enacted by the U.S. Congress or implemented by any administration or how such efforts would impact its business. Litigation and legislation over the ACA and other healthcare reform measures are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. Further, additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under or related to the ACA remain possible. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted that impact government health programs. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under government payor programs, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. While any proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, the U.S. Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. The Company expects that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal health care programs and commercial payers will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates, if approved, or additional pricing pressures. \n\n&#160; \n\nIndividual states in the U.S. have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third party payors or other restrictions could harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. These or other reforms could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates, if approved, or put pressure on its product pricing. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action in the U.S. If the Company or any third parties it may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if the Company or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, any approved product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are and will be dependent on third-party contract research organizations to conduct all of our clinical trials. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are and will be dependent on third-party research organizations to conduct all of our clinical trials with respect to our product candidates, including any candidates that we may develop in the future. If we are unable to obtain any necessary testing services on acceptable terms, we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. If we rely on third parties for human trials, we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties. These third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we so request. We may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research organizations to conduct our human trials. We are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the trial&#8217;s general plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nWe rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe do not have and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. Consequently, we lack the physical plant to formulate and manufacture our product candidates, which are currently being manufactured entirely by commercial third-party manufacturers. We, through Citius Oncology, have secured supply agreements for LYMPHIR with the two third-party facilities who are in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) as generally accepted by the FDA. If LYMPHIR, or any other product candidate we develop or might acquire in the future receives FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our products. If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on our current source or any future source or sources to manufacture our product candidates, either for pre-clinical or clinical trials or for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for preclinical, clinical, and commercial purposes. We might not be successful in identifying additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any that we do identify. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our product candidates and our financial performance might be materially and adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, before any of our collaborators can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates, each must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process. Manufacturing of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP and applicable non-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. Our contracted manufacturing facilities must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection might significantly delay FDA approval of our product candidates. If any of our collaborators fails to comply with these requirements, we would be subject to possible regulatory action which could limit the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our product candidates. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; We might be unable to identify manufacturers for commercial supply on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would generally require compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our product candidates after receipt of FDA approval, if any; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our product candidates in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Our contract manufacturers might not perform as agreed or might not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our product candidates for commercialization; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Currently, the contract manufacturer for our clinical supplies is foreign, which increases the risk of shipping delays, adds the risk of import restrictions, and adds the risk of political and environmental uncertainties that might affect those countries; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers&#8217; compliance with these regulations and standards; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our product candidates, we might not own, or might have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation with our licensors; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; Operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including a bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier or a natural disaster or a pandemic such as COVID-19; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We might compete with other companies for access to these manufacturers&#8217; facilities and might be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than us. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials or the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or any foreign regulatory agency or the commercialization of our product candidates and could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf we materially breach or default under any of our license agreements, the licensor party to such agreement will have the right to terminate the license agreement, which termination may materially harm our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur commercial success will depend in part on the maintenance of our current and any future license agreements. Our license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. For example, under our current license agreements, we are required to use commercially reasonable diligence to develop and commercialize a product and to satisfy specified payment obligations for various developmental and regulatory milestones. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our current license agreements or any future license agreements with any party, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license. Each of our license agreements provides the licensor with a right to terminate the license agreement for our material breach or default under the agreement, including the failure to make any required milestone or other payments. Should the licensor under any of our license agreements exercise such a termination right, we would lose our right to the intellectual property under the respective license agreement, which loss may materially harm our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nAny termination, or breach by, or conflict with our strategic partners could harm our business . \n\n&#160; \n\nIf we or any of our current or future collaborators fail to renew or terminate any of our collaboration or license agreements or if either party fails to satisfy its obligations under any of our collaboration or license agreements or complete them in a timely manner, we could have difficulty completing the development of any of our product candidates and potentially lose significant sources of revenue, which could result in an adverse impact on our operations and financial condition as well as volatility in any future revenue. In addition, our agreements with our collaborators may have provisions that give rise to disputes regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. These and other possible disagreements could lead to termination of the agreement or delays in collaborative research, development, supply, or commercialization of our product candidates, or could require or result in litigation or arbitration. Any such conflicts with our collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and could have a negative impact on our relationship with existing collaborators, adversely affecting our business and revenues. Finally, any of our collaborations may prove to be unsuccessful. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our executive management and other key personnel and the loss of any of our executive management or key personnel or our inability to successfully hire their successors could harm our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our executive management and other key personnel, who have extensive experience and specialized expertise in our business. Our Chief Executive Officer, Leonard Mazur, our Vice Chairman, Myron Holubiak, and our Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President, Myron Czuczman, in particular have significant experience in the running of pharmaceutical companies and/or drug development itself. This depth of experience is of significant benefit to us, especially given the small size of our management team and our company, including our subsidiaries. The loss of the services of any of Mr. Mazur, Mr. Holubiak and Dr. Czuczman as well as any other member of our executive management or any key employees, including those at NoveCite or Citius Oncology, could harm our ability to attract capital and develop and commercialize our product candidates. Neither we nor NoveCite and Citius Oncology has key man life insurance policies. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nIf we are unable to retain or hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business might be harmed. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe utilize the services of a clinical management team on a part-time basis to assist us in managing our ongoing Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and intend to do so for future preclinical and clinical trials. Pursuant to the shared services agreement with Citius Pharma, Citius Oncology utilizes the services of Citius Pharma&#8217;s management team to assist it in managing the clinical and pre-clinical trials. Following the Business Combination, pursuant to an amended and restated shared services agreement, Citius Oncology will continue to utilize the services of Citius Pharma employees with expertise in product manufacturing and commercialization for the planned launch of LYMPHIR. While we believe this will provide us with sufficient staffing for our current and future development efforts, we will need to hire or contract with additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing in connection with the continued development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Combined Company&#8217;s board members are anticipated to also be directors of Citius Pharma, and the executive officers are also employees of Citius Pharma pursuant to the shared services agreement. Citius Oncology expects to rely on these individuals and the other expertise and personnel made available under the shared services agreement for the foreseeable future. \n\n&#160; \n\nCompetition for qualified directors, officers and employees is intense, and we cannot be certain that our retention of these individuals or any search for additional such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success. In addition, we may be unable to attract and retain those qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for effective management. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, officers and directors, the management and operation of our business could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe expect to need to increase the size of our organization to further develop our product candidates, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe will need to manage our anticipated growth and increased operational activity, including as a result of the continuing development of LYMPHIR and our other product candidates. Our personnel, systems, and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy will require that we: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; manage our research and development activities and our regulatory trials effectively; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; attract and motivate sufficient numbers of talented employees or consultants; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; manage our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors, collaborators and other third parties; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; develop internal sales and marketing capabilities or establish collaborations with third parties with such capabilities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; commercialize our product candidates; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nThis planned future growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and may require our management to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, and give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and consultants and reduced productivity among remaining employees and consultants. We may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or increase our revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nWe plan to grow and develop our business through acquisitions of or investment in new or complementary businesses, products or technologies, and the failure to manage these acquisitions or investments, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business strategy is based on the acquisition of additional product candidates. This is evidenced by our in-licensing of NoveCite in October 2020 and LYMPHIR in September 2021. We might consider opportunities to acquire or invest in other technologies, products and businesses that might enhance our capabilities or complement our current product candidates. Potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks, including potential problems or issues associated with the following: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; assimilating the acquired technologies, products, or business operations; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls, and policies; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; diversion of our management&#8217;s attention from our preexisting business; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; maintaining or obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or complying with regulatory standards; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; adverse effects on existing business operations. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment in other technologies or businesses. We do not know if we will identify other suitable acquisitions, whether we will be able to successfully complete any acquisitions, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired product, technology or business into our business operations or retain key personnel, suppliers, or collaborators. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur ability to successfully develop our business through acquisitions including the in-licensing of LYMPHIR, will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate suitable target businesses or technologies and obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time consuming and might disrupt our ongoing operations. If we are unable to efficiently integrate any acquired business, technology or product into our business operations, our business and financial condition might be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nConflicts of interest may arise from our relationship with NoveCite. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we beneficially owned 75% of the voting power of NoveCite&#8217;s outstanding common stock; Novellus owns the other 25%. As a result of our partial ownership, our relationship with NoveCite could give rise to certain conflicts of interest that could have an impact on our and NoveCite&#8217;s respective research and development programs, business opportunities, and operations generally. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; Even though we utilize different technologies than NoveCite, we could find ourselves in competition with it for research scientists, financing and other resources, licensing, manufacturing, and distribution arrangements. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; NoveCite will engage for its own business in research and product development programs, investments, and business ventures, and we will not be entitled to participate or to receive an interest in those programs, investments, or business ventures other than to the extent as a stockholder in NoveCite. NoveCite will not be obligated to present any particular research and development, investment, or business opportunity to us, even if the opportunity would be within the scope of our research and development plans or programs, business objectives, or investment policies. These opportunities may include, for example, opportunities to acquire businesses or assets, including but not limited to patents and other intellectual property that could be used by us or by NoveCite. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; Each conflict of interest will be resolved by our respective boards of directors in keeping with their fiduciary duties and such policies as they may implement from time to time. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; There is overlap among our board of directors, senior management and research staffs and that of NoveCite. Two of our directors, Myron Holubiak and Leonard Mazur, also serve as directors of NoveCite. In addition, Myron Holubiak serves as Chief Executive Officer and Jaime Bartushak serves as Chief Financial Officer of both Citius Pharma and NoveCite. These overlapping positions could interfere with the duties owed by such individuals to Citius Pharma. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory and Legal Environment \n\n&#160; \n\nWe might not obtain the necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize for sale any product candidates we are currently developing or that we may acquire or seek to develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA an NDA or a BLA demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research, pre-clinical studies, and clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA&#8217;s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in products that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for their indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process and might require us to conduct additional pre-clinical and clinical testing, perform post-marketing studies or otherwise limit or impose conditions on any additional approvals we obtain. The approval process might also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our product candidate&#8217;s regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals might: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; impose costly procedures on us; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; diminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise enjoy. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA might ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs or BLAs. Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product candidate, the approval might limit the indicated medical uses for the product, limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of one or more of our product candidates could severely undermine our business by leaving us without saleable products, and therefore without any potential sources of revenues, until another product candidate could be developed or obtained and successfully developed, approved and commercialized. Foreign jurisdictions impose similar regulatory approval processes and we will face the same risks if we seek foreign approval for any of our product candidates. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to successfully develop or acquire any product candidate. \n\n&#160; \n\nFollowing any regulatory approval of any product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our other product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or by a foreign regulatory authority, we will be required to comply with extensive regulations for product manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping. Regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the products or to whom and how we may distribute an approved product. Even if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product&#8217;s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. For example, the label ultimately approved for any of our product candidates, if any, may include restrictions on use. If so, we may be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize that product candidate. The FDA could also require a registry to track the patients utilizing the product or implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) that could restrict access to the product, which would reduce our revenues and/or increase our costs. Potentially costly post-marketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy, or to investigate specific issues of interest to the regulatory authority. Similar risks apply in foreign jurisdictions. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Similar regulatory programs exist in foreign jurisdictions. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our future approved products, if any, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspections. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a pharmaceutical product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer&#8217;s facilities to continual review and inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of that product, up to and including, withdrawal of the product from the market. If the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it could result in regulatory action and additional costs to us. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, if any, subject our company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceutical products may change. New statutory requirements may be enacted or additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. CMOs and their vendors or suppliers may also face changes in regulatory requirements from governmental agencies in the U.S. and other countries. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, extent or effects of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or elsewhere. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we might not be permitted to market any future approved products and our business could suffer. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe could be forced to pay substantial damage awards if product liability claims that may be brought against us are successful. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe use of any of our product candidates in pre-clinical and clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, may expose us to liability claims and financial losses resulting from the use or sale of our product candidates. We have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our pre-clinical and clinical trials of $5.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible of $25,000 per bodily injury and property damage occurrence, and a medical expense per person limit of $25,000. There can be no assurance that our existing insurance coverage will extend to any other product candidates in the future. Any product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy all liabilities resulting from product liability claims. A successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable terms, if at all. Even if a claim is not successful, defending such a claim would be time consuming and expensive, may damage that product&#8217;s and our reputations in the marketplace, and would likely divert management&#8217;s attention, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our Company. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business depends on protecting our intellectual property. \n\n&#160; \n\nWithout the intellectual property rights we have already obtained, as well as the further rights we are also pursuing, our competitors would have opportunity to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products. Our success, competitive position, and future revenues, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries, as appropriate. However, the patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise might not provide any competitive advantage; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which might make significant investments in competing technologies, might seek, or might already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our product candidates either in the U.S. or in international markets; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Countries other than the U.S. might have less restrictive patent laws than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; As a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there might be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for product candidates that prove successful. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition, the USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated. \n\n&#160; \n\nBecause the time period from filing a patent application to the issuance, if ever, of the patent is often more than three years and because any regulatory approval and marketing for a pharmaceutical product often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates and technologies will likely be substantially less than 20 years. For example, the U.S. patent on the original Mino-Lok composition expires in June 2024, and the U.S. patent on the stabilized Mino-Lok composition expires in November 2036. Since we anticipate significant additional time before FDA approval could be obtained, the maximum market exclusivity afforded by the statutory term of the currently issued patents would be less than 17 years. In the U.S., the European Union and some other jurisdictions, patent term extensions are available for certain delays in either patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval processes. However, due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions, there is no assurance that our patents will be granted extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval. \n\n&#160; \n\nAdditionally, patent law is subject to change and varies among the U.S. and foreign countries. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors&#8217; abilities to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents that we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future. \n\n&#160; \n\nPatent and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections will prove inadequate. Our business and prospects will be harmed if these protections prove insufficient. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nWe rely on trade secret protections through confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties, and the breach of these agreements could adversely affect our business and prospects. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe rely on trade secrets, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, collaborators, suppliers, and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors. We might be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management&#8217;s attention from our operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we might have to forego developing and/or selling any approved products, pay damages, or defend against litigation. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf our product candidates, methods, processes, and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we might have to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; obtain licenses, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; abandon an infringing product candidate; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; redesign our product candidates or processes to avoid infringement; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; pay damages; and/or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; defend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nAny of these events could substantially harm our earnings, financial condition, and operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe U.S. government could have &#8220;march-in rights&#8221; to certain of our intellectual property. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf at any time federal monies are used in support of the research and development activities at MDACC that resulted or in the future result in certain of our issued pending U.S. patent applications, the federal government retains what are referred to as &#8220;march-in rights&#8221; to patents that are granted on these applications. Our license agreements for Mino-Lok and Mino-Wrap each provide that in the event of such governmental funding, our rights are subject to the government&#8217;s prior rights, if any. In addition, the license agreements provide that we will comply with the requirements of any agreement between MDACC and the governmental funding entity. If applicable, this could require us to grant the U.S. government either a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license to the patented invention in any field of use, upon terms that are reasonable for a particular situation. Circumstances that could trigger march-in rights generally would be set out in the agreement between MDACC and the funding governmental entity and could include, for example, failure to take, within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in a field of use, failure to satisfy the health and safety needs of the public and failure to meet requirements of public use specified by federal regulations. A funding governmental entity could elect to exercise these march-in rights on their own initiative or at the request of a third party; however, the exercise of such march-in rights has been historically rare when the patent holder (or its licensee) is practicing the patent invention although there can be no assurance that such rights would not be exercised. This same risk would apply to any other license into which we enter if the licensor receives government funding for the product candidate that is the subject of the license. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have registered a trademark with the USPTO for the marks &#8220;LYMPHIR&#8221; and &#8220;Mino-Lok&#8221;. Thses and any other trademarks or trade names we may obtain may be challenged, infringed, diluted, tarnished, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. The Company may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in the markets of interest. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt similar trade names or trademarks, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement, dilution or tarnishment claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company&#8217;s efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Our Planned Spinoff of Citius Oncology \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, which may not be satisfied or waived on a timely basis, if at all, and we may be unable to complete the Spinoff of Citius Oncology as a separate public company. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe consummation of the Business Combination is subject to customary closing conditions for transactions involving special purpose ac quisition companies, including, among others: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Act; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; receipt of required consents and approvals from certain governmental authorities; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; no agreement with any governmental authority pursuant to which Citius Pharma or TenX has agreed not to consummate the Business Combination; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued or granted any law that has the effect of restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the transaction; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; TenX has at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets as of the Closing; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; no outstanding or uncured written notice has been received by TenX from Nasdaq stating that it has failed, or would reasonably be expected to fail to meet the Nasdaq initial listing requirements or Nasdaq continued listing requirements as of the Effective Date for any reason; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; the parties have performed and complied in all material respects with the obligations, covenants and agreements required by the Merger Agreement; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; customary bring down conditions related to the accuracy of the parties&#8217; respective representations, warranties and pre-Closing covenants in the Merger Agreement, including the absence of any &#8220;Material Adverse Effect&#8221; (as defined in the Merger Agreement); ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; TenX&#8217;s registration statement that has been filed with the SEC has become effective; and ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; the requisite TenX&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; approvals have been received. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nAdditionally, as previously announced, Citius Pharma is in the process of formulating a plan of distribution to its stockholders of a portion of the shares of the Combined Company that Citius Pharma is to receive in the Business Combination (the &#8220;Distributi on&#8221;). The criteria to determine the timing, size and other factors related to such Distribution will be determined and announced by us at a later date. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the Business Combination or Spinoff or a Distribution due to many factors outside of our control. The completion of the anticipated Spinoff of Citius Oncology and any Distribution will also require significant amounts of our management&#8217;s time and effort, which may divert management&#8217;s attention from operating and growing our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spinoff. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company believes that separating LYMPHIR into a standalone entity would create two focused standalone public companies that are better positioned to pursue their strategic priorities, invest in growth opportunities, and attract new investors. The Company also believes that the Business Combination and Spinoff will result in significant benefits to our Company and our stockholders as a result of unlocking the value we believe that Citius Oncology would have as a standalone publicly traded company. However, by separating from Citius Pharma, Citius Oncology might be more susceptible to market fluctuations and we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect Citius Oncology to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all. Further, if the Business Combination&#8217;s benefits do not meet the expectations of financial analysts, or due to the other factors discussed in this &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; section and elsewhere in this report, the market price of the Combined Company&#8217;s common stock might decline or increase in volatility. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nCitius Oncology currently has only one product candidate that is in late stage development and it is heavily dependent on the approval, launch and commercial success of LYMPHIR. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn April 2022, Citius Pharma transferred the assets related to LYMPHIR to Citius Oncology. LYMPHIR is Citius Oncology&#8217;s only late-stage product candidate, and it has not been approved for commercial sale, while the other product candidates are in the pre-clinical stage. Upon completion of the anticipated Business Combination, Citius Pharma will become a majority stockholder of the Combined Company, and as a result, we will only be entitled to a portion of the benefits, if any, that flow from the development by Citius Oncology of its LYMPHIR product candidate or any other product candidates that it might develop. \n\n&#160; \n\nCitius Oncology is entirely dependent upon the successful commercial launch of LYMPHIR to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. Even if Citius Oncology receives approval for LYMPHIR for the treatment of CTCL, the commercial launch in the U.S. is not expected to occur until the second half of 2024. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate Citius Oncology&#8217;s current business and predict its future prospects due to the other factors discussed in this &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; section and elsewhere in this report. We cannot assure you that LYMPHIR will gain market acceptance among physicians, health care payors, patients and the medical community, which is critical to its commercial success. \n\n&#160; \n\nEven after the completion of the Business Combination, the Combined Company will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. \n\n&#160; \n\nCitius Oncology&#8217;s operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception and Citius Oncology expects to significantly increase its spending to continue its commercialization efforts for LYMPHIR, advance development of LYMPHIR for other indications and launch and commercialize any product candidates for such indications for which it receives regulatory approval. Furthermore, following the Business Combination, the Combined Company will have additional costs associated with operating as a public company. The Combined Company will require additional capital to fund its other operating expenses and capital expenditures. \n\n&#160; \n\nFollowing consummation of the Business Combination, until the Combined Company is able to generate significant revenue, if ever, we expect it to finance its operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations or other strategic transactions. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to it, or at all. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert its management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect its ability to develop and commercialize its product candidates. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf Citius Oncology or the Combined Company raises additional funds through collaborations or strategic alliances with third parties, it may have to relinquish valuable rights to its product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or technologies, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to it. If Citius Oncology or the Combined Company is unsuccessful in its efforts to raise additional financing on acceptable terms, it may be required to significantly reduce or cease its operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe amount and timing of its future funding requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including but not limited to: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; the costs and expenses associated with its ongoing commercialization efforts for LYMPHIR; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the degree of success it experiences in commercializing LYMPHIR; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the revenue generated by sales of LYMPHIR and other products that may be approved, if any; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; the scope, progress, results and costs of conducting studies and clinical trials for its other product candidates, if any, resulting from its ongoing research with LYMPHIR for other possible indications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for LYMPHIR and its other product candidates; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the costs of manufacturing LYMPHIR and any other potential product candidates it develops; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the timing and amount of any milestone, royalty or other payments it is required to make pursuant to any current or future license agreements; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the extent to which LYMPHIR or any of its other potential product candidates, if approved for commercialization, is adopted by the physician community; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the effect of competing products and product candidates and other market developments; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the number and types of future product candidates it might develop and commercialize; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; any product liability or other lawsuits related to its products candidates and any approve products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the expenses needed to attract, hire and retain skilled personnel; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the costs associated with being a public company after the closing of the Business Combination; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; its need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the extent and scope of its general and administrative expenses. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nFuture sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of the Combined Company&#8217;s common stock may cause the price of its common stock to decline. \n\n&#160; \n\nCitius Oncology is, and after the Business Combination, the Combined Company is expected to be, authorized to issue an aggregate of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Any additional equity or equity-related financing may be dilutive to its stockholders, and debt or equity financing, if available, might subject Citius Oncology or the Combined Company to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. Citius Oncology, and after the Business Combination, the Combined Company, might also issue additional shares of common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, or for other business purposes. \n\n&#160; \n\nPursuant to the amended and restated registration rights agreement to be entered into in connection with the Business Combination, certain stockholders TenX, the TenX sponsor and certain equity holders of Citius Pharma can demand that the Combined Company can register their registrable securities under certain circumstances and will each also have piggyback registration rights for these securities. The registration of these securities will permit the public sale of such securities, subject to certain contractual restrictions imposed by the amended and restated registration rights agreement and the Merger Agreement. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nThe future sales or issuances of any such shares of the Combined Company&#8217;s common stock or common stock equivalents may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Combined Company or our common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe announcement of the proposed Business Combination could disrupt Citius Pharma&#8217;s or Citius Oncology&#8217;s relationships with their respective customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as their respective operating results and business generally. \n\n&#160; \n\nRisks rela ting to the impact of the announcement of the Business Combination on our business include the following: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; our employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; customers, suppliers, business partners and other parties with which we maintain business relationships may experience uncertainty about its future and seek alternative relationships with third parties, seek to alter their business relationships with us or fail to extend an existing relationship with us; and ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; we have expended and will continue to expend significant costs, fees and expenses for professional services and transaction costs in connection with the proposed Business Combination. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nIf any of the aforementioned risks were to materialize, they could lead to significant costs which may impact the Combined Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash available to fund its business. \n\n&#160; \n\nConflicts of interest may arise from the Combined Company&#8217;s relationship with Citius Pharma. \n\n&#160; \n\nImmediately after the Business Combination, all of the Combined Company&#8217;s directors, executive officers and employees will also be directors and employees of Citius Pharma; the employees will all be available pursuant to the amended and restated shared services agreement. As a result of this arrangement, the Combined Company&#8217;s relationship with Citius Pharma could give rise to certa in conflicts of interest that could have an impact on its research and development programs, business opportunities, and operations generally. \n\n&#160; \n\nEven though the Combined Company is developing different technologies in different fields than Citius Pharma, the Combined Company could find itself in competition with Citius Pharma for research scientists, financing and other resources, licensing, manufacturing, and distribution arrangements. The Combined Company will engage for its own business in research and product development programs, investments, and business ventures, and Citius Pharma will not be entitled to participate or to receive an interest in those programs, investments, or business ventures. The Combined Company will not be obligated to present any particular research and development, investment, or business opportunity to us, even if the opportunity would be within the scope of our research and development plans or programs, business objectives, or investment policies. These opportunities may include, for example, opportunities to acquire businesses or assets, including but not limited to patents and other intellectual property that could be used by the Combined Company or by Citius Pharma. \n\n&#160; \n\nPotential conflicts of interest could also arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between Citius Pharma and the Combined Company regarding the terms of the amended and restated shared services agreement governing the services provided by Citius Pharma to the Combined Company and the relationship between the companies. Potential conflicts of interest may also arise if the Combined Company enters into additional commercial arrangements with Citius Pharma in the future. As a result of these actual or apparent conflicts, the Combined Company or Citius Pharma, might be precluded from pursuing certain growth initiatives. \n\n&#160; \n\nEach conflict of interest will be resolved by the respective boards of directors in keeping with their fiduciary duties and such policies as they may implement from time to time. As noted above, there will be overlap among the Combined Company&#8217;s board of directors, senior management and research staffs and that of Citius Pharma. These overlapping positions could interfere with the duties owed by such individuals to Citius Pharma. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nA Distribution in connection with or following the Spinoff of Combined Company shares to our stockholders could result in significant tax liability to Citius Pharma and our stockholders. \n\n&#160; \n\nA Distribution of Combined Company shares to our stockholders would not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss, and therefore, our stockholders could be subject to tax. Each U.S. holder who receives Combined Company stock in a Distribution would generally be treated as receiving a Distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Combined Company common stock received, which would generally result in (i) a taxable dividend to the stockholder to the extent that stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of Citius Pharma&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits; (ii) a reduction in the stockholder&#8217;s basis (but not below zero) in Citius Pharma&#8217;s common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder&#8217;s shares of Citius Pharma&#8217;s earnings and profits; and (iii) a taxable gain from the exchange of Citius Pharma&#8217;s stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the stockholder&#8217;s share of Citius Pharma&#8217;s earnings and profits and the stockholder&#8217;s basis in its Citius Pharma stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nCitius Pharma will also recognize a taxable gain in an amount up to the fair market value of any distributed Combined Company stock in excess of the taxable basis in such distributed shares. \n\n&#160; \n\nAny legal proceedings in connection with the Business Combination, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Business Combination. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn connection with business combination transactions similar to the proposed Business Combination, it is not uncommon for lawsuits to be filed against the parties and/or their respective directors and officers alleging, among other things, that the proxy statement/prospectus provided to stockholders contains false and misleading statements and/or omits material information concerning the transaction. Although no such lawsuits have yet been filed in connection with the Business Combination, it is possible that such actions may arise and, if such actions do arise, they generally would seek, among other things, injunctive relief and an award of attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses. Defending such lawsuits could require the parties to incur significant costs and draw the attention of the parties&#8217; management teams away from the consummation of the Business Combination. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Business Combination is consummated may adversely affect the Combined Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such legal proceedings could delay or prevent the Business Combination from being consummated within the expected timeframe. \n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Our Securities \n\n&#160; \n\nOur failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq&#8217;s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nCitius Pharma common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market and following the Business Combination, the Combined Company intends to separately list its common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market. In order to maintain these listings, each entity must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nOn September 12, 2023, Citius Pharma received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;) indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the minimum bid price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market closed below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until March 11, 2024, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. If at any time before March 11, 2024, the bid price of the Company's common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company with a written confirmation of compliance with the Bid Price Rule. While Citius Pharma intends to engage in efforts to regain compliance, and thus maintain our listing, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements in the future. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf Citius Pharma&#8217;s (or following the Business Combination, the Combined Company&#8217;s) common stock were to be removed from listing with Nasdaq, it may be subject to the so-called &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that define a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange, which is the exception on which we currently rely. For any transaction involving a &#8220;penny stock,&#8221; unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. If our common stock were delisted and determined to be a &#8220;penny stock,&#8221; a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf Citius Pharma&#8217;s (or following the Business Combination, the Combined Company&#8217;s) common stock is delisted and there is no longer an active trading market for our shares, it may, among other things: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; cause stockholders difficulty in selling Citius Pharma&#8217;s or the Combined Company&#8217;s shares without depressing the market price for the shares or selling the shares at all; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; substantially impair the ability to raise additional funds; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities; and/or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; result in potential breaches of representations or covenants of agreements pursuant to which Citius Pharma or the Combined Company made representations or covenants relating to compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of management&#8217;s time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business and results of operations. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nA delisting would also reduce the value of Citius Pharma&#8217;s or the Combined Company&#8217;s equity compensation plans, which could negatively impact the ability to retain employees. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the foreseeable future, to finance our operations, including possible acquisitions or strategic transactions, we expect to issue equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of September 30, 2023, there were 158,857,798 shares of common stock outstanding, 50,923,819 shares underlying warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $1.50 per share and 13,305,171 shares underlying options with a weighted average exercise price of $1.79 per share. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock or common stock equivalents may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock or publicly traded warrants. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Certificate of Incorporation allows for our Board of Directors to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of the common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of any such preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of one or more series of preferred stock that would grant preferential rights to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the preferred shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of the common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than the common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of the common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and we (and following the Business Combination, the Combined Company) do not anticipate paying cash dividends on its capital in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on the capital stock will depend on the respective earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting them at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. In addition, the ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants in any future outstanding indebtedness that either entity may incur. Since the Combined Company does not intend to pay dividends, a stockholder&#8217;s ability to receive a return on such stockholder&#8217;s investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of the Combined Company&#8217;s common stock. There is no guarantee that either entity&#8217;s common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which its stockholders have purchased it. \n\n&#160; \n\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and under Nevada law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment of management. \n\n&#160; \n\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change of control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium f or their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Among other things, these provisions include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; the authorization of 10,000,000 shares of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock, the rights, preferences and privileges of which may be established and shares of which may be issued by our Board of Directors at its discretion from time to time and without stockholder approval; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; allowing for the creation of a staggered Board of Directors; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#9679; establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nAdditionally , Nevada&#8217;s &#8220;combinations with interested stockholders&#8221; statutes prohibit certain business &#8220;combinations&#8221; between certain Nevada corporations and any person deemed to be an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; for two years after such person first becomes an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; unless (i) the corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors approves the combination (or the transaction by which such person becomes an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221;) in advance, or (ii) the combination is approved by the Board of Directors and 60% of the corporation&#8217;s voting power not beneficially owned by the interested stockholder, its affiliates and associates. Furthermore, in the absence of prior approval, certain restrictions may apply even after such two-year period. For purposes of these statutes, an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; is any person who is (x) the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, or (y) an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the two previous years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. The definition of the term &#8220;combination&#8221; is sufficiently broad to cover most significant transactions between the corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221;. Subject to certain timing requirements set forth in the statutes, a corporation may elect not to be governed by these statutes. We have not included any such provision in our articles of incorporation. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are not currently subject to Nevada&#8217;s &#8220;acquisition of controlling interest&#8221; statutes that contain provisions governing the acquisition of a controlling interest in certain Nevada corporations. If these laws were to apply to us, they might further discourage companies or persons interested in acquiring a significant interest in or control of the Company, regardless of whether such acquisition may be in the interest of our stockholders. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe effect of these statutes may be to potentially discourage parties interested in taking control of the Company from doing so if it cannot obtain the approval of our Board of Directors. \n\n&#160; \n\n", "item_7": " Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Management&#8217;s discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements.

Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the filing date of this report. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nHistorical Background \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of first-in-class critical care products with a focus on oncology, anti-infectives in adjunct cancer care, unique prescription products and stem cell therapies. On September 12, 2014, we acquired Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC as a wholly-owned subsidiary. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn March 30, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Leonard-Meron Biosciences, Inc. (&#8220;LMB&#8221;) by issuing shares of our common stock. We acquired identifiable intangible assets of $19,400,000 related to in-process research and development and recorded goodwill of $9,346,796 for the excess of the purchase consideration over the net assets acquired. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn September 11, 2020, we formed NoveCite, Inc. (&#8220;NoveCite&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, of which we own 75% of the issued and outstanding capital stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn August 23, 2021, we formed Citius Oncology, Inc. (formerly Citius Acquisition Corp.) as a wholly-owned subsidiary in conjunction with the acquisition of LYMPHIR, but Citius Oncology did not begin operations until April 2022, when Citius Pharma transferred the assets related to LYMPHIR to Citius Oncology, including the related license agreement with Eisai and the related asset purchase agreement with Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories SA, a subsidiary of Dr. Reddy&#8217;s. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn-process research and development of $19,400,000 represents the value of LMB&#8217;s leading drug candidate (Mino-Lok), which is an antibiotic solution used to treat catheter-related bloodstream infections and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of eight years commencing upon revenue generation. Goodwill of $9,346,796 represents the value of LMB&#8217;s industry relationships and its assembled workforce. Goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested at least annually for impairment. In-process research and development of $40,000,000 represents the value of our September 2021 acquisition of an exclusive license for LYMPHIR (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of twelve years commencing upon revenue generation. \n\n&#160; \n\nThrough September 30, 2023, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to product development, raising capital, building infrastructure through strategic alliances and coordinating activities relating to our proprietary products. We have not yet realized any revenues from our operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nRecent Developments \n\n&#160; \n\nOn October 23, 2023, Citius Pharma and Citius Oncology entered into the Merger Agreement with TenX and Merger Sub. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, (i) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, that Merger Sub will merge with and into Citius Oncology, with Citius Oncology surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of TenX, and (ii) that prior to the Effective Time, TenX will migrate to and domesticate as a Delaware corporation. The publicly traded Combined Company is to be named &#8220;Citius Oncology, Inc.&#8221; \n\n&#160; \n\nPatent and Technology License Agreements \n\n&#160; \n\nMino-Lok&#174; &#8211; LMB has a patent and technology license agreement with Novel Anti-Infective Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;NAT&#8221;) to develop and commercialize Mino-Lok on an exclusive, worldwide sub-licensable basis, as amended. Since May 2014, LMB has paid an annual maintenance fee, which began at $30,000 and has increased over five years to $90,000, where it will remain until the commencement of commercial sales of a product subject to the license. LMB will also pay annual royalties on net sales of licensed products, with royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low double digits. In limited circumstances in which the licensed product is not subject to a valid patent claim and a competitor is selling a competing product, the royalty rate is in the low single digits. After a commercial sale is obtained, LMB must pay minimum aggregate annual royalties that increase in subsequent years. LMB must also pay NAT up to $1,100,000 upon achieving specified regulatory and sales milestones. Finally, LMB must pay NAT a specified percentage of payments received from any sub licensees. \n\n&#160; \n\nMino-Wrap &#8211; On January 2, 2019, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (&#8220;Licensor&#8221;), whereby we in-licensed exclusive worldwide rights to the patented technology for any and all uses relating to breast implants. We intend to develop a liquefying gel-based wrap containing minocycline and rifampin for the reduction of infections associated with breast implants following breast reconstructive surgeries. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Mino-Wrap under several regulatory scenarios and achieve milestones associated with these regulatory options leading to an approval from the FDA. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nUnder the license agreement, we paid a nonrefundable upfront payment of $125,000. We are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $30,000, commencing in January 2020 that increases annually by $15,000 per year up to a maximum of $90,000. Annual maintenance fees cease on the first sale of product. We also must pay up to an aggregate of $2.1 million in milestone payments, contingent on the achievement of various regulatory and commercial milestones. Under the terms of the license agreement, we also must pay a royalty of mid- to upper-single digit percentages of net sales, depending on the amount of annual sales, and subject to downward adjustment to lower- to mid-single digit percentages in the event there is no valid patent for the product in the U.S. at the time of sale. After the first sale of product, we will owe an annual minimum royalty payment of $100,000 that will increase annually by $25,000 for the duration of the term. We will be responsible for all patent expenses incurred by Licensor for the term of the agreement although Licensor is responsible for filing, prosecution, and maintenance of all patents. \n\n&#160; \n\nNoveCite &#8211; On October 6, 2020, our subsidiary NoveCite entered into a license agreement with Novellus Therapeutics Limited (&#8220;Licensor&#8221;), whereby NoveCite acquired an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to develop and commercialize a stem cell therapy based on the Licensor&#8217;s patented technology for the treatment of acute pneumonitis of any etiology in which inflammation is a major agent in humans. Upon execution of the license agreement, NoveCite paid an upfront payment of $5,000,000 to Licensor and issued to Licensor shares of Novecite&#8217;s common stock representing 25% of NoveCite&#8217;s currently outstanding equity. We own the other 75% of NoveCite&#8217;s currently outstanding equity. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn July 2021, Novellus was acquired by Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics (&#8220;Brooklyn&#8221;). Pursuant to this transaction, the NoveCite license was assumed by Brooklyn with all original terms and conditions. In October 2021, Brooklyn changed its name to Eterna Therapeutics Inc. (&#8220;Eterna&#8221;). \n\n&#160; \n\nAs part of the Novellus and Brooklyn merger transaction, the 25% non-dilutive position per the subscription agreement between Novellus and NoveCite was removed. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnder the license agreement, NoveCite is obligated to pay Licensor up to an aggregate of $51,000,000 in regulatory and developmental milestone payments. NoveCite also must pay a royalty equal to low double-digit percentages of net sales, commencing upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product. This royalty is subject to downward adjustment on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis to an upper-single digit percentage of net sales in any country in the event of the expiration of the last valid patent claim or if no valid patent claim exists in that country. The royalty will end on the earlier of (i) date on which a biosimilar product is first marketed, sold, or distributed by Licensor or any third party in the applicable country or (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim in that country. In the case of a country where no licensed patent ever exists, the royalty will end on the later of (i) the date of expiry of such licensed product&#8217;s regulatory exclusivity and (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the applicable country. In addition, NoveCite will pay to Licensor an amount equal to a mid-twenties percentage of any sublicensee fees it receives. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnder the terms of the license agreement, in the event that Licensor receives any revenue involving the original cell line included in the licensed technology, then Licensor shall remit to NoveCite 50% of such revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nLYMPHIR - In September 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Dr. Reddy&#8217;s to acquire its exclusive license of E7777 (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Citius Pharma subsequently renamed E7777 as LYMPHIR. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnder the terms of this agreement, Citius Pharma acquired Dr. Reddy&#8217;s exclusive license of LYMPHIR from Eisai and other related assets owned by Dr. Reddy&#8217;s (now owned by Citius Oncology). Our exclusive license rights, through our subsidiary, include rights to develop and commercialize LYMPHIR in all markets except for Japan and certain parts of Asia. Additionally, we, through our subsidiary, have an option on the right to develop and market the product in India. Eisai retains exclusive development and marketing rights for the agent in Japan and Asia. Dr. Reddy&#8217;s received a $40 million upfront payment and is entitled to up to $40 million in development milestone payments related to CTCL approvals in the U.S. and other markets, up to $70 million in development milestones for additional indications, as well as commercial milestone payments and low double-digit tiered royalties on net product sales. Eisai is to receive a $6 million development milestone payment upon initial approval and additional commercial milestone payments related to the achievement of net product sales thresholds. Eisai was responsible for completing the CTCL clinical trial, and CMC activities through the filing of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) for LYMPHIR with the FDA. The BLA was filed in September 2022. We, through Citius Oncology, will be responsible for development costs associated with potential additional indications. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn July 29, 2023, we received a Complete Response Letter, (&#8220;CRL&#8221;) from the FDA regarding the BLA seeking approval for LYMPHIR. The FDA has required that we incorporate enhanced product testing, and additional controls agreed to with the FDA during the market application review. The FDA raised no concerns relating to the safety and efficacy clinical data package. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn September 8, 2023, we announced that the FDA agreed with our plans to address the requirements outlined in the CRL. The guidance from the FDA provides a path for completing the necessary activities to support the resubmission of the BLA. No additional clinical efficacy or safety trials have been requested by the FDA for the resubmission. Based on the feedback from the FDA, we plan to complete the CRL remediation activities by the end of the year and file the resubmission in early 2024. \n\n&#160; \n\nResults of Operations for Year Ended September 30, 2023 compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; Year Ended September 30, 2023 &#160; &#160; Year Ended September 30, 2022 &#160; Revenues &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating expenses: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Research and development &#160; &#160; 14,819,729 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17,655,482 &#160; General and administrative &#160; &#160; 15,295,584 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11,754,609 &#160; Stock-based compensation &#8211; general and administrative &#160; &#160; 6,616,705 &#160; &#160; &#160; 3,905,954 &#160; Total operating expenses &#160; &#160; 36,732,018 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33,316,045 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Operating loss &#160; &#160; (36,732,018 ) &#160; &#160; (33,316,045 ) Interest income &#160; &#160; 1,179,417 &#160; &#160; &#160; 251,399 &#160; Gain on sale of New Jersey net operating losses &#160; &#160; 3,585,689 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Loss before income taxes &#160; &#160; (31,966,912 ) &#160; &#160; (33,064,646 ) Income tax expense &#160; &#160; 576,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 576,000 &#160; Net loss &#160; $ (32,542,912 ) &#160; $ (33,640,646 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\nWe did not generate any revenues for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, research and development expenses were $14,819,729 as compared to $17,655,482 for the year ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of $2,835,753. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development costs for Mino-Lok&#174; decreased by $33,894 to $4,216,761 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $4,250,655 for the year ended September 30, 2022, driven primarily by decreased start-up costs associated with the global clinical research organization, Biorasi, LLC, that assisted in the opening of international sites, primarily in India, for the Phase 3 Mino-Lok trial. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development costs for our Halo-Lido product candidate increased by $1,378,662 to $4,076,010 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $2,697,348 for the year ended September 30, 2022 due to higher costs associated with the initiation of the Phase 2 study for the year ended September 30, 2023. On June 20, 2023, we announced that the high dose formulation of CITI-002, a lidocaine and halobetasol propionate combination formulation, provided a meaningful reduction in symptom severity, as reported by patients, when compared to individual components alone. Moreover, there were no reported significant adverse events and CITI-002 was well tolerated by patients in the study. Citius intends to schedule an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to begin planning the next steps in the regulatory and clinical development program for CITI-002. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, research and development costs for our proposed novel cellular therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were $193,898 as compared to $1,777,288 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease of $1,583,390 was primarily related to lower preclinical and manufacturing costs in the year ended September 30, 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, research and development expenses for our LYMPHIR product candidate were $6,081,385 as compared to $8,693,775 during the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease of $2,612,390 was primarily due to reduced costs associated with the completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as the completion and submission of the Biologics License Application to the FDA, which we filed in September 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe expect that research and development expenses will continue to stabilize in fiscal 2024 as we continue to focus on the commercialization of LYMPHIR, and complete our Phase 3 trial for Mino-Lok and our Phase 2b trial for Halo-Lido. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses were $15,295,584 as compared to $11,754,609 for the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of $3,540,975. The primary reason for the increase was costs associated with pre-launch and market research activities associated with LYMPHIR. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs, professional fees for legal, regulatory, accounting and corporate development services, and investor relations expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based Compensation Expense \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, stock-based compensation expense was $6,616,705 as compared to $3,905,954 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Stock-based compensation expense includes options granted to directors, employees, and consultants. The primary reason for the $2,710,751 increase in stock-based compensation expense was the grant of options under the Citius Oncology stock plan. Option expense under the Citius Oncology stock plan was $1,965,500 during the year ended September 30, 2023. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense also includes $130,382 and $133,332, respectively, for the NoveCite stock option plan. In fiscal year 2023, we granted options to our new employees and additional options to other employees, our directors, and consultants. At September 30, 2023, unrecognized total compensation cost related to unvested options for Citius Pharma common stock of $4,840,874 is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years, unrecognized total compensation cost related to unvested options for Citius Oncology common stock of $18,882,500 is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years, and unrecognized total compensation cost related to unvested options for NoveCite common stock of $47,575 is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.7 years. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Income \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned $1,179,417 of interest income compared to $251,399 of interest income during the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase of $928,018 was due to higher interest rates earned on the investment of the remaining proceeds from our equity offerings and common stock warrant exercises in money market accounts. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income for the year ended September 30, 2023 also includes the $3,585,689 gain recognized in connection with the sale of certain New Jersey income tax net operating losses to a third party under the New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recorded deferred income tax expense of $576,000 for in each of the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 related to the amortization for taxable purposes of its in-process research and development asset. \n\n&#160; \n\nNet Loss \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, we incurred a net loss of $32,542,912 compared to a net loss of $33,640,646 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The $1,097,734 decrease in the net loss was primarily due to the increase in other income of $4,513,707 offsetting the increase in our operating expenses of $3,415,973. \n\n&#160; \n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\n&#160; \n\nLiquidity and Working Capital \n\n&#160; \n\nCitius Pharma has incurred operating losses since inception and incurred net losses of $32,542,912 and $33,640,646 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2023, Citius Pharma had an accumulated deficit of $162,231,379. Citius Pharma&#8217;s net cash used in operations during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $29,060,212 and $28,361,256, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs a result of our common stock offerings and common stock warrant exercises in fiscal year 2021 and the May 2023 registered direct offering, the Company had working capital of approximately $29,000,000 at September 30, 2023. We expect that we will have sufficient funds to continue our operations through August 2024. At September 30, 2023, Citius Pharma had cash and cash equivalents of $26,480,928 available to fund its operations. The Company&#8217;s only source of cash flow since inception has been from financing activities. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company received net proceeds of $13,829,450, from the issuance of equity. Our primary uses of operating cash were for in-licensing of intellectual property, product development and commercialization activities, employee compensation, consulting fees, legal and accounting fees, insurance, and investor relations expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancing Activities \n\n&#160; \n\nIn November 2022, the Company was selected to participate in New Jersey&#8217;s Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer (NOL) Program and received $3,585,689 million in non-dilutive capital through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority on December 29, 2022. \n\n&#160; \n\nOn May 8, 2023, the Company closed a registered direct offering with certain institutional investors for 12,500,001 common shares and warrants to purchase 12,500,001 common shares, at a purchase price of $1.20 per share of common stock and accompanying warrant, for gross proceeds of $15,000,001. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.50 per share, are exercisable six months from the date of issuance, and expire five years from the date of issuance. The Company also issued 875,000 warrants to the placement agent as part of the transaction. Net proceeds of the offering totaled approximately $13,798,183. \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we received $31,267 in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options. \n\n&#160; \n\nBased on our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2023, we expect that we will have sufficient funds to continue our operations through August 2024. We expect to raise additional capital in the future to support our operations beyond August 2024. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in raising the needed capital or that the proceeds will be received in an amount or in a timely manner to support our operations. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nInflation \n\n&#160; \n\nOur management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. \n\n&#160; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#160; \n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the judgments and estimates required by the following accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development costs, including upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators who are performing research and development activities under contractual agreement with us, are expensed as incurred. We defer and capitalize our nonrefundable advance payments that are for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. When we are reimbursed by a collaboration partner for work we perform, we record the costs incurred as research and development expenses and the related reimbursement as a reduction to research and development expenses in our statement of operations. Research and development expenses primarily consist of clinical and non-clinical studies, materials and supplies, third-party costs for contracted services, and payments related to external collaborations and other research and development related costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn-process Research and Development and Goodwill \n\n&#160; \n\nIn-process research and development of $19,400,000 represents the value of LMB&#8217;s drug candidate, Mino-Lok, an antibiotic lock solution in Phase 3 clinical development, which if approved, would be used to treat catheter-related bloodstream infections, and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of eight years commencing upon revenue generation. In-process research and development of $40,000,000 represents the value of our September 2021 acquisition of an exclusive license for LYMPHIR (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of twelve years commencing upon revenue generation. \n\n&#160; \n\nGoodwill represents the value of LMB&#8217;s industry relationships and its assembled workforce. Goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested at least annually for impairment. \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company reviews intangible assets annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life of any intangible asset. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows, the Company writes down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value for the period identified. No impairments have occurred since the acquisitions of our intangible assets through September 30, 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired, in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) 2017-04, Intangibles &#8211; Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment . Goodwill is first qualitatively assessed to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. Factors that management considers in this assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management and strategy and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a one-step test is then performed in accordance with ASU 2017-04. Under the simplified model, a goodwill impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company performed a qualitative assessment for its 2023 analysis of goodwill. Based on this assessment, management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Accordingly, no further testing was performed as management believes that there are no impairment issues with respect to goodwill as of September 30, 2023. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nWe follow accounting guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns are required to be evaluated to determine whether the tax positions are &#8220;more-likely-than-not&#8221; of being sustained by the applicable tax authorities. Tax positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded in the financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which we do not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not. \n\n&#160; \n\n", "item_7a": " Item 7A.
