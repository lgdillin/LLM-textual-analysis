{"companyName": "CEMTREX INC", "filedAt": "2023-12-28T14:50:21-05:00", "item_1a": " ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS &#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 8 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\n\n&#160;\n\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report, including the consolidated audited financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on Form 10-K, with respect to any investment in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this report (unless another date is indicated) and we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements in light of future development.\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Macroeconomics Conditions and International Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\n&#160;\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for our products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for our products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\n\n&#160;\n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectability risk on our trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on our ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of our financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\n&#160;\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues (such as COVID-19), industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on us and our customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, and other channel partners.\n\n&#160;\n\nRestrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect our operations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer and distribute products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where we derive a significant portion of our revenues and/or have significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require us to take various actions, including changing suppliers and restructuring business relationships. Changing our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on our business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect our business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 9 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nMany of our operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond our control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture and deliver products to our customers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to our product and service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to our business, we can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at our suppliers and contract manufacturers. While our suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to our business, and harm to our reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, us due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in our operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n\n&#160;\n\nVolatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur international operations accounted for approximately 9.2% of our net sales in 2023. We are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on translating the financial statements of our international operations, most of which are denominated in local currencies, into the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and reported profits in our international operations. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products, along with other local costs incurred in foreign countries for foreign entities with U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, fluctuating exchange rates may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by compliance with import and export laws. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the import and export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Covid-19 \n\n&#160;\n\nThe global pandemic may disrupt our business or the business of our customers. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of corona virus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19 was reported. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency and Global Pandemic. COVID-19 has severely impacted economies around the world.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 10 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and the results of our operations in this fiscal year, primarily with delays in expected orders by many customers and new product development, including newer versions of surveillance software since our technical facility in Pune, India has been under lock down on multiple occasions. Bookings and revenue have largely recovered in this calendar year compared to last year. In addition, due to delays in certain supply chain areas, the expected launch times of our new products and new versions has resulted in delays of several months.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe broader implications of COVID-19 on our results from operations going forward remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause adverse effects to our customers, suppliers or business partners in locations that have or will experience more pronounced disruptions, which could result in a reduction to future revenue and manufacturing output as well as delays in our new product development activities. However, on the other hand, opportunities in the video surveillance field have been growing for Vicon products.\n\n&#160; \n\nThe extent of the pandemic&#8217;s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend in large part on future developments, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Future developments include the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, the emergence of new virus variants that are more contagious or harmful than prior variants, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact both within and outside the jurisdictions where we operate, the impact on governmental programs and budgets, the development of treatments or vaccines, and the resumption of widespread economic activity. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation, we are unable to predict with any confidence the likely impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations. This could materially impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition \n\n&#160; \n\nThere is no guarantee that cash flow from operations and/or debt and equity financings will provide sufficient capital to meet our expansion goals working capital needs or fund our operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur current strategic plan includes the expansion of our company both organically and through acquisitions if market conditions and competitive conditions allow. Due to the long-term nature of investments in acquisitions and other financial needs to support organic growth, including working capital, we expect our long-term and working capital needs to periodically exceed the short-term fluctuations in cash flow from operations. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional external capital from the sale of common stock, preferred stock and debt instruments as market conditions may allow, in addition to cash flow from operations (which may not always be sufficient), to fund our growth and working capital needs.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn the event that we need to raise significant amounts of external capital at any time or over an extended period, we face a risk that we may need to do so under adverse capital market conditions with the result that our existing shareholders, as well as persons who acquire our common stock, may incur significant and immediate dilution should we raise capital from the sale of our common or preferred stock. Similarly, we may need to meet our external capital needs from the sale of secured or unsecured debt instruments at interest rates and with such other debt covenants and conditions as the market then requires. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise external capital on terms that are reasonable in light of current market conditions. In the event that we are not able to do so, those who acquire our common stock may face significant and immediate dilution and other adverse consequences. Further, debt covenants contained in debt instruments that we issue may limit our financial and operating flexibility with consequent adverse impact on our common stock market price.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future, which could result in the market price of our common stock declining. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have incurred net losses, including net losses attributable to Cemtrex, Inc. shareholders of $9.2 million in 2023, $13.0 million in 2022, and $7.8 million in 2021. We have an accumulated deficit of $64.2 million as of September 30, 2023. We expect to continue to incur significant product development, sales and marketing and administrative expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability. We cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability in the future or, if we achieve profitability, to sustain it. If we do not achieve and maintain profitability, the market price for our common stock may decline, perhaps substantially.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk, market risk, and fluctuations in the value of its investment portfolio. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company may, from time to time invest excess cash that the Company has on hand in large cap securities listed on major exchanges, including stocks and options. The Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 11 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough we have not recognized any material losses related to our cash equivalents, short-term investments, or long-term investments, future declines in the market values of such investments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have substantial debt which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund operations and prevent us from meeting our obligations under outstanding indebtedness. \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, our total indebtedness was approximately $24.4 million, including notes payable of $18.1 million, mortgage payable of $3.4 million, vendor financed purchase of $0.7 million, and bank loans of $2.2 million, including $0.9 million of PPP loans that the Company expects to be forgiven. By comparison, as of September 30, 2022, our total indebtedness was approximately $20.6 million, including notes payable of $17.7 million, mortgage payable of $2.3 million, and bank loans of $0.6 million, including $0.1 million of PPP loans. For 2023 and 2022 approximately $14.5 million and $16.9 million, respectively, of such debt is classified as current. This substantial debt could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, future business opportunities and capital expenditures; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, debt service requirements and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) we may face a competitive disadvantage to lesser leveraged competitors; (iv) our debt service requirements could make it more difficult to satisfy other financial obligations; and (v) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond management&#8217;s control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of indebtedness, if available at all, could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. Despite our significant amount of indebtedness, we may need to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to our continued operations and there is no assurance we will be able to obtain sufficient additional equity or debt financing in the future. \n\n&#160;\n\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to retain or renew our credit agreements and other finance agreements in the future. In the event our company grows rapidly, the uncertain economic climate continues, or we acquire one or more other companies, additional financing resources will likely be necessary in the current or future fiscal years. As a smaller public company with a limited ability to attract and obtain financing, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient additional equity or debt financing in the future on terms that are reasonable in light of current market conditions.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to our Business \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are substantially dependent upon the success and continued market acceptance of our technology, the absence of which may significantly reduce our sales, profits and cash flow and adversely impact our financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nCompeting technologies may be offered by both existing competitors or by those that enter the market, and these competing technologies may offer a better cost-benefit ratio than our products and/or at lower prices with the result that our sales, profits, and cash flow may suffer significantly over an extended period with serious adverse impact on our financial condition.\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 12 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nWe have taken a multi-operational approach, and some of our business segments have historically failed to benefit our company to date, and there remains a risk that our remaining segments may not prove to be successful. We may divest or expand into new areas that are outside of our current business activities and those activities may not prove to be successful. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe continuously assess the composition of our portfolio businesses to ensure it is aligned with our strategic objectives and positioned to maximize growth and return in the coming years. Since our business concerns new and developing technologies, and many of these endeavors fail, some of the businesses in our portfolio may not be successful in generating sufficient revenue to be a viable option for our company.\n\n&#160;\n\nCurrently, the Company has the following business segments, consisting of (i) Security, (ii) Industrial Services, and (iii) Cemtrex Corporate. Within these segments there are a number of technologies that we are pursuing, as discussed in this annual report under &#8220;Item 1. Business.&#8221; There is a risk that one or more of our technologies will not be successful in generating revenue to sustain the expenditures associated with its existence. Moreover, having multiple business segments may present challenges, such as fluctuations in our operating results, using the company&#8217;s limited resources on less worthy business pursuits, and distracting management from obtaining its goals with respect to our overall operations. If we are unable to establish our technologies in the market, and overcome the challenges of doing so, we could go out of business.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs we continuously review our portfolio of businesses we may exit or enter into new business activities which may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur future operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development and marketing of new and improved products and services through our Security segment, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully introduce new products and services into the market. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe success of new and improved products and services through our Security segment depends on our research and development efforts and the initial acceptance of our products and solutions by consumers. Our business is affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research and development, production and/or marketing of new products and services due to lack of capital, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.\n\n&#160; \n\nOur future operating results depends in part on the continued successful operation of our Industrial Services segment, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this business. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe success of selling services through our Industrial Services segment depends on our ability to hire and retain talent, our ability to market these services successfully to clients, the overall demand for these services, and the quality of our workmanship by our customers, among other factors. Our business is affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the delivery of services due to lack of capital or lack of adequate talent, which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to compete in our markets.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow our client base, establish sustainable revenues and succeed overall. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9632; general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we sell our services and conduct operations; legislative policies where we sell our services and conduct operations; &#160; &#9632; the budgetary constraints of our customers; seasonality; &#160; &#9632; success of our strategic growth initiatives; &#160; &#9632; costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 13 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9632; timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors; product and service mix, availability, utilization and pricing; &#160; &#9632; the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets; &#160; &#9632; movements in interest rates or tax rates; &#160; &#9632; changes in, and application of, accounting rules; &#160; &#9632; changes in the regulations applicable to us; &#160; &#9632; litigation matters. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nAs a result of these factors, we may not succeed in our business, and we could go out of business.\n\n&#160; \n\nWe operate in a cyclical business, which could result in significant fluctuations in demand for our products. \n\n&#160; \n\nCyclical changes in our customers&#8217; businesses have, in the past, resulted in, and may in the future result in, significant fluctuations in demand for our products, selling prices, and our profitability. Most of our customers operate in cyclical industries. Their requirements for our technologies fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in general economic conditions, technological changes, customer demand, and other factors. During periods of increasing demand, our customers typically seek to increase their inventory of our products to avoid production bottlenecks. When demand for their products peaks and begins to decline, as has happened in the past, they tend to reduce or cancel orders for our products while they use up accumulated inventory. Business cycles vary somewhat in different geographical regions and customer industries. Significant fluctuations in sales of our products affect our unit manufacturing costs and affect our profitability by making it more difficult for us to predict our production, raw materials, and shipping needs. Changes in demand mix, needed technologies, and end-use markets may adversely affect our ability to match our products, inventory, and capacity to meet customer demand and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We are also vulnerable to general economic events or trends beyond our control, and our sales and profits may suffer in periods of weak demand.\n\n&#160; \n\nOur sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for our products, as to which there can be no assurance. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe uncertainty in the United States and in the international economic and political environment could result in a decline in demand for our products in any industry. Our gross margins are dependent upon our ability to maintain sales volumes at levels that allow us to cover our fixed costs and variable costs per unit. To the extent that one or more product lines experience a significant and protracted decline in sales volume, we may experience significant declines in our gross margins that may result in losses. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws affecting our customers could result in decreases in demand of our products and thus decrease our gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn these circumstances, we anticipate that we could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our existing and future customers. Orders from our customers are subject to cancellation, and delivery schedules from our customers fluctuate as a result of changes in our customers&#8217; demand, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations, and may result in higher inventory levels. Higher inventory levels may cause us to need greater external financing, which adversely affects our financial performance.\n\n&#160; \n\nOur products face intense competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, and pricing pressure from competitors, which could adversely affect our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nAll of our product lines are subject to significant competition from existing and future competitors, market conditions and technological change, or a combination of them, and our sales revenues and gross margins may suffer protracted and serious declines with the result that we would likely incur protracted losses. Further, the barriers to entry in several of our lines of business are not so significant that we may be facing competition from others who see significant opportunities to enter the market and undercut our prices with products that possess superior technological attributes at prices that offer our customers a better value. In this instance, we could incur protracted and significant losses and persons who acquire our common stock would suffer losses thereby.\n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain our market share. Competition and customer pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other input cost increases. Our results of operations will suffer if profit margins decrease, as a result of a reduction in prices, increased input costs or other factors, and if we are unable to increase sales volumes to offset those profit margin decreases. We may also need to increase spending on marketing, advertising and new product innovation to protect existing market share or increase market share. The success of our investments is subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. As a result, our increased expenditures may not maintain or enhance market share and could result in lower profitability.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 14 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our products could negatively impact our customers and us. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have no real control over factors affecting the industries that utilize our products and to the extent that any one or more of these industries change dramatically, we may be facing significant financial challenges that are in excess of our existing capabilities. These factors include:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; increased competition among our customers and their competitors; &#160; &#9679; the inability of our customers to develop and market their products; &#160; &#9679; recessionary periods in our customers&#8217; markets; &#160; &#9679; the potential that our customers&#8217; products become obsolete; &#160; &#9679; our customers&#8217; inability to react to rapidly changing technology; and &#160; &#9679; our customers&#8217; inability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the company&#8217;s results of operations. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nIf we are unable to develop new products, our competitors may develop and market products with better features that may reduce demand for our existing and potential products or otherwise result in our products becoming obsolete and could materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain profitability. \n\n&#160; \n\nThere are many larger competitors who compete directly with us and who have significantly greater financial, technological and research resources. This may serve to severely damage our ability to market and sell our products at price levels that would allow us to achieve and maintain profit margins and positive cash flow.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are a smaller public company, and we face rapid technological change in many of our product markets and we may not be able to introduce any successful new products or any enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis, or at all. This could result in prolonged and significant losses. In addition, our introduction of new products could adversely affect sales of certain of our existing products if these new products directly compete with our existing products. If our competitors develop innovative technologies that are superior to our products or if we fail to accurately anticipate market trends and respond on a timely basis with our own innovations, we may not achieve sufficient growth in its revenues to attain profitability or if we do, we may not be able sustain profitability.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, timely and successful development of new products, including software development, market acceptance of these products and our ability to manage the risks associated with these introductions. These risks include development and production capabilities, management of inventory levels to support anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality defects in the early stages of introduction, and obsolescence risk of existing products.\n\n&#160;\n\nDeveloping and maintaining a patent portfolio is an expensive and time-consuming process and there is no assurance the Company will successfully develop patents to protect the intellectual property it is working on.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted and we could incur significant costs and reputational harm as a result \n\n&#160;\n\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information; to manage a variety of business processes and activities; and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing and sales activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, and suppliers around the world. Many of the information technology systems used by us globally have been in place for many years and not all hardware and software is currently supported by vendors. These information technology systems are susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 15 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to various cyber-attacks. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks or events. Any future significant compromise, breach, or misuse of our data security could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation. The ever-evolving threats mean us and our third-party service providers must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security compromises, breaches, or misuses. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\n\n&#160;\n\nThird-party service providers, such as distributors, subcontractors, vendors, and data processors have access to certain portions of our sensitive data. In the event that these service providers do not appropriately protect our data, the result could be a security breach or loss of our data. Any such loss of data by our third-party service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our customers or suppliers. Furthermore, the disclosure of non-public sensitive information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are also in the process of converting certain information technology networks and systems and consolidating certain global systems. If such projects fail, or if unexpected technical difficulties arise, our operations and financial systems could be adversely affected. Further, we could incur additional costs or require additional technical support to resolve such difficulties.\n\n&#160; \n\nOur operating results are sensitive to raw material and resale product availability, quality, and cost \n\n&#160;\n\nWe seek to have many sources of supply for each of our major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters, international trade tariffs, wars, pandemics, disputes and or other events. Despite market price volatility for certain requirements and materials pricing pressures at some of our businesses, the raw materials and various purchased components needed for our products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. In some instances, lead times have extended beyond normal due to logistic delays and labor shortages occurring globally. Some of our products, however, require the use of raw materials that are available from only a limited number of regions around the world, are available from only a limited number of suppliers, or may be subject to significant fluctuations in market prices. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials, our key suppliers experience financial difficulties, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials. Our inability to recover increased costs through increased sales prices could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. For periods in which the prices for these raw materials rise, we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers, which would result in decreased sales margins for the products in which they are used. For periods in which prices for these raw materials decline, we may be required, as has occurred in the past, to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials and products. Depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost, the write-down could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe resell products manufactured by other component and interconnect product manufacturers. Should these manufacturers experience difficulties supplying the products that we resell, or such suppliers use other channels to market their products, we could experience lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Related to Legal Uncertainty \n\n&#160; \n\nWe could be subject to additional civil penalties or face criminal penalties and sanctions if we violate the terms of settlement with the SEC. \n\n&#160;\n\nOn September 30, 2022, acting pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by the Company, the SEC issued an order pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, directing the Company to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder (the &#8220;SEC Order&#8221;).\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 16 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile we have already paid the penalties imposed by the order into which we entered pursuant to the SEC Order, it contains ongoing and continuing requirements that we refrain from violating the Securities Act. Any future violation of applicable securities laws by us or management could result in harsher sanctions and fines, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plans. SEC staff can make reasonable requests from us for further evidence of compliance. Such requests for further information, record-keeping requirements and others generally could divert management&#8217;s attention from implementing its business plans and could require additional material expenditures by us to legal counsel or other advisors and service providers. Further issues could reduce investor and shareholder confidence in our company and could result in a failure to execute on our business plan, which would negatively impact our business. A copy of the SEC Order can be found at www.sec .gov.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur global operations subject us to many different and complex laws and rules, and we may face difficulty in compliance. \n\n&#160;\n\nDue to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations (including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Export Administration Act the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and the U.K. Modern Anti-Slavery Act); which prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where and how we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries, what personal information we can transfer, and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government. Although we have procedures and policies in place that should mitigate the risk of violations of these laws, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficiently effective. If, and when we acquire new businesses, we may not be able to ensure that the pre-existing controls and procedures meant to prevent violations of the rules and laws were effective, and we may not be able to implement effective controls and procedures to prevent violations quickly enough when integrating newly acquired businesses. Acquisitions of new businesses in new non-U.S. jurisdictions may also subject us to new regulations and laws, and we may face difficulties ensuring compliance with these new requirements.\n\n&#160;\n\nProvisions in the Delaware law and our Bylaws could make it very difficult for an investor to bring any legal actions against our directors or officers for violations of their fiduciary duties or could require us to pay any amounts incurred by our directors or officers in any such actions. \n\n&#160;\n\nMembers of our board of directors and our officers will have no liability for breaches of their fiduciary duty of care as a director or officer, except in limited circumstances, pursuant to provisions in the Delaware law and our Bylaws. Accordingly, you may be unable to prevail in a legal action against our directors or officers even if they have breached their fiduciary duty of care. In addition, our Bylaws allow us to indemnify our directors and officers from and against any and all costs, charges and expenses resulting from their acting in such capacities with us. This means that if you were able to enforce an action against our directors or officers, in all likelihood, we would be required to pay any expenses they incurred in defending the lawsuit and any judgment or settlement they otherwise would be required to pay. Accordingly, our indemnification obligations could divert needed financial resources and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf we fail to establish, maintain, and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our technology, our financial condition, results of operations and business could be negatively impacted. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur ability to establish, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights with respect to our proprietary technologies, patents, patent applications, software and other rights will be a significant factor in determining our future financial and operating performance. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of patent, trade secret and copyright laws. We also use confidentiality and other provisions in our agreements that restrict access to and disclosure of our confidential know-how and trade secrets.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have filed patent applications with respect to many aspects of our technologies. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any of these applications will ultimately result in issued patents or, if patents are issued, that they will provide sufficient protections for our technology against competitors. Although we have filed various patent applications for some of our core technologies, we currently hold only six issued patents, with two in the United States and four in Canada, and we may face delays and difficulties in obtaining our other filed patents, or we may not be able to obtain such patents at all.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 17 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nOutside of these patent applications, we seek to protect our technology as trade secrets and technical know-how. However, trade secrets and technical know-how are difficult to maintain and do not provide the same legal protections provided by patents. In particular, only patents will allow us to prohibit others from using independently developed technology that are similar. If competitors develop knowledge substantially equivalent or superior to our trade secrets and technical know-how or gain access to our knowledge through other means such as observation of our technology that embodies trade secrets at customer sites which we do not control, the value of our trade secrets and technical know-how would be diminished.\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile we strive to maintain systems and procedures to protect the confidentiality and security of our trade secrets and technical know-how, these systems and procedures may fail to provide an adequate degree of protection. For example, although we generally enter into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, and strategic partners restricting the disclosure and use of trade secrets, technical know-how and confidential information, we cannot provide any assurance that these agreements will be sufficient to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure. In addition, some of the technology deployed at customer sites in the future, which we do not control, may be readily observable by third parties who are not under contractual obligations of non-disclosure, which may limit or compromise our ability to continue to protect such technology as a trade secret.\n\n&#160;\n\nMonitoring and policing unauthorized use and disclosure of intellectual property is difficult. If we learned that a third party was in fact infringing or otherwise violating our intellectual property, we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation. Litigation relating to our intellectual property may not prove successful and might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\n\n&#160;\n\nFrom our customers&#8217; standpoint, the strength of the intellectual property under which we control can be a critical determinant of the value of our products and services. If we are unable to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property, it may become more difficult for us to attract new customers. Any such development could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may not have sufficient financial resources to defend our intellectual property rights or otherwise successfully defend against claims that we have infringed on a third party&#8217;s intellectual property and, as a result, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n&#160;\n\nEven if such claims are not valid, they could subject us to significant costs. In addition, it may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. We may not have sufficient financial resources to defend our intellectual property rights or otherwise to successfully defend the company against valid or spurious claims that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others. An adverse outcome in litigation or any similar proceedings could force us to take actions that could harm its business. These include: (i) ceasing to sell products that contain allegedly infringing property; (ii) obtaining licenses to the relevant intellectual property which we may not be able to obtain on terms that are acceptable, or at all; (iii) indemnifying certain customers or strategic partners if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated another party&#8217;s intellectual property; and (iv) redesigning products that embody allegedly infringing intellectual property. Any of these results could adversely and significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of defending or asserting any intellectual property claim, both in legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and lead to significant and protracted losses.\n\n&#160;\n\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of our product or any future products that we may develop. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our products and the future sale of planned products. We may be sued if any of our products allegedly causes injury. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. We may also be subject to liability for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product or planned products caused injuries, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9632; decreased demand for our product or any planned products that we may develop; &#160; &#9632; injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 18 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9632; significant costs to defend the related litigation and distraction to our management team; &#160; &#9632; substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs; &#160; &#9632; loss of revenue; and &#160; &#9632; the inability to commercialize any future products that we may develop. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nSuch events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured parties, delay, negatively impact, or end our opportunity to market those products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our product, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could harm our business.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. The identification of one or more material weaknesses would preclude a conclusion that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( &#8220; COSO &#8221; ) in Internal Control&#8212;Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that as of September 30, 2023, that our internal control over financial reporting were effective. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an &#8220;smaller reporting company.&#8221; At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 19 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Acquisitions \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have grown through acquisitions and are continuously looking to fund other acquisitions; our failure to raise funds for acquisitions may have the effect of slowing down our growth and our use of funds for acquisitions subjects us to acquisition-related risks. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe intend to make acquisitions of complementary (including competitive) businesses, products and technologies. However, any future acquisitions may result in material transaction costs, increased interest and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, increased depreciation expense and increased operating expenses, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. Acquisitions will require integration of acquired assets and management into our operations to realize economies of scale and control costs. Acquisitions may involve other risks, including diversion of management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing internal development of our business and risks inherent in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience. In connection with future acquisitions, we may make potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. In addition, consummation of acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated business uncertainties, contingent liabilities or legal matters relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not fully indemnify us. There can be no assurance that our business will grow through acquisitions, as anticipated.\n\n&#160; \n\nWe may fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions or otherwise be unable to benefit from pursuing acquisitions. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow through acquisitions and joint ventures across all product categories and we expect to continue a strategy of selectively identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products. We may be unable to identify, negotiate, and complete suitable acquisition opportunities on reasonable terms. There can be no assurance that any business acquired by us will be successfully integrated with our operations or prove to be profitable to us. We may incur future liabilities related to acquisitions. Should any of the following problems, or others, occur as a result of our acquisition strategy, the impact could be material:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9632; difficulties integrating personnel from acquired entities and other corporate cultures into our business; &#160; &#9632; difficulties integrating information systems; &#160; &#9632; the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies; &#160; &#9632; the assumption of liabilities and exposure to undisclosed or unknown liabilities of acquired companies; or &#160; &#9632; the diversion of management attention from existing operations. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nRisks Related to Our Management and Control Persons \n\n&#160; \n\nThe loss of the services of Saagar Govil for any reason would materially and adversely affect our business operations and prospects. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur financial success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of Saagar Govil, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Saagar Govil possesses management, financial expertise, engineering, sales and marketing experience concerning our company that our other officers do not have. We have not entered into an employment arrangement with Mr. Govil, and we have not obtained key man insurance over him. There can be no assurance that Saagar Govil will continue to provide services to us. A voluntary or involuntary departure by Saagar Govil could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract a qualified replacement for them in a timely manner.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, including our management, sales and marketing, finance, and especially our design and technical personnel. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 20 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nOur management stockholders have significant stockholdings in and influence over our company which could make it impossible for public stockholders to influence the affairs of our company. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are a &#8220;controlled company&#8221; under Nasdaq Listing Rules. Approximately 90% of our outstanding voting shares, which includes our common stock, Series C preferred stock and Series 1 preferred stock, are beneficially held by Saagar Govil, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to certificate of designation for our Series C preferred, each outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the result of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of such vote multiplied by 10.01, and divided by (ii) the total number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding at the time of such vote, at each meeting of our shareholders with respect to any and all matters presented to our shareholders for their action or consideration, including the election of directors. As a result of Saagar Govil&#8217;s ownership of our common stock, Series C preferred stock, and Series 1 preferred stock, he controls, and will control in the future, substantially all matters requiring approval by the stockholders of our company, including the election of all directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This could make it impossible for public stockholders to influence the affairs of our company.\n\n&#160; \n\nRisks Related to Our Securities \n\n&#160; \n\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur common stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our securities in the public market, including the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of our Series 1 warrants and stock options, and shares issued as consideration in future acquisitions, or the market perceives that such sales may occur, the market price of our securities could fall and we may be unable to sell our securities in the future.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur securities may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing. \n\n&#160; \n\nThe market price of our securities may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; our business strategy and plans; &#160; &#9679; changing factors related to doing business in various jurisdictions within the United States; &#160; &#9679; new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines and timing of regulatory approvals; &#160; &#9679; general and industry-specific economic conditions; &#160; &#9679; additions to or departures of our key personnel; &#160; &#9679; variations in our quarterly financial and operating results; &#160; &#9679; changes in market valuations of other companies that operate in our business segments or in our industry; &#160; &#9679; lack of trading liquidity; &#160; &#9679; announcements about our business partners; &#160; &#9679; Intellectual property disputes; &#160; &#9679; Operating results below or exceeding expectations or period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; &#160; &#9679; Whether we achieve profits or not; &#160; &#9679; changes in accounting principles; and &#160; &#9679; general market conditions, economic and other external factors. ##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nThe market prices of the securities of early-stage companies, particularly companies like ours without consistent product revenues and earnings, have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In the past, companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation. Whether or not meritorious, litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs, divert our management&#8217;s attention and resources and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160; \n\nOur Series 1 preferred stock and all of our existing and future indebtedness rank senior to our common stock in the event of a liquidation, winding up or dissolution of our business. \n\n&#160; \n\nIn the event of our liquidation, winding up or dissolution, our assets would be available to make payments to holders of all existing and future indebtedness and Series 1 preferred stock before payments to holders of our common stock. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying amounts to the holders of our indebtedness and Series 1 preferred stock, to pay anything to common stockholders. As of September 30, 2023, we had total consolidated debt of approximately $37.8 million and 2,293,116 shares issued and 2,229,016 shares of Series 1 preferred stock outstanding. Any liquidation, winding up or dissolution of our company or of any of our wholly or partially owned subsidiaries would have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 21 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nOur common stockholders may be adversely affected by the issuance of any subsequent series of preferred stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur certificate of incorporation does not restrict our ability to offer one or more additional new series of preferred stock, any or all of which may rank equally with or have preferences over our common stock as to dividend payments, voting rights, rights upon liquidation or other types of rights. We would have no obligation to consider the specific interests of the holders of common stock in creating any such new series of preferred stock or engaging in any such offering or transaction. Our creation of any new series of preferred stock or our engaging in any such offering or transaction could have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe public trading market for the common stock may be limited in the future. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CETX. The trading volume fluctuates and there have been time periods during which the common stock trading volume has been limited. Management can make no assurances that trading volume will not be similarly limited in the future. Without an active trading market, there can be no assurance of any liquidity or resale value of the common stock, and stockholders may be required to hold their shares of common stock for an indefinite period of time.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may not pay cash dividends on our common stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur board of directors declared a one-time cash dividend on our common stock in April 2017. The terms of our series 1 preferred stock provide for the payment of semiannual dividends on the last day of March and September in each year, which began in March 2017. No other cash dividends have been declared or paid by us on our stock during either of the two most recent fiscal years or the period through the date of this Annual Report. Other than with respect to our series 1 preferred stock, our board of directors declares dividends when, in its discretion, it determines that a dividend payment, as opposed to another use of cash, is in the best interests of the stockholders. Such decisions are based on the facts and circumstances then existing including, without limitation, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. As a result, we cannot predict when, or whether, another dividend on our common stock will be declared in the future.\n\n&#160;\n\nIf our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If the price of our Common Stock is less than $5.00, our Common Stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser&#8217;s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our Common Stock, and therefore shareholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough our Common Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the exchange may subsequently delist our Common Stock or Series 1 Preferred Stock if we fail to comply with ongoing listing standards. \n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough our Common Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the exchange will require us to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity standards on an ongoing basis in order to continue the listing of our Common Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock. If we fail to meet these continued listing requirements, our Common Stock and/or our Series 1 Preferred stock may be subject to delisting. If our Common Stock and/or our Series 1 Preferred Stock are delisted and we are not able to list such Common Stock or Series 1 Preferred Stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market; However, if this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited availability of market quotations for our Common Stock and Series 1 Preferred Stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, in the event of such delisting, we could experience a decreased ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future. Even though our securities are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our securities will develop or be sustained after our initial listing.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START 22 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\n", "item_7": " ITEM 7.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments. \n\n&#160; \n\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#8217;s accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company&#8217;s most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations and require management&#8217;s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. \n\n&#160; \n\nValuation of Goodwill \n\n&#160; \n\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $4,400,000 of goodwill. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In accordance with the FASB revised guidance on &#8220;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment,&#8221; a company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than- not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill. \n\n&#160; \n\nAssessing the Company&#8217;s goodwill for impairment analyses is complex and highly judgmental due to the nature of qualitive assessment and, where necessary, the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as future operating results, cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be materially affected by future market or economic conditions. \n\n&#160; \n\nRelated Parties \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company sold two of its operating entities to Saagar Govil, Chairman of the Board, CEO, President and Secretary, additionally, there are transactions related to Ducon Industries, Inc. owned by Aron Govil, Founder, and former CFO and Executive director all of which are discussed in Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements. The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved b. description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement. \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness Combinations \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, The Company acquired Heisey Mechanical, Ltd. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The Company accounts for business combinations under Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 805 &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Upon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date. \n\n&#160; \n\nPlease see Note 2 for detailed information regarding our significant accounting policies and estimates in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 25 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nResults of Operations - For the fiscal years ending September 30, 2023 and 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nTotal revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023, increased by $14,341,782 or 32% to $59,368,562 from $45,026,780 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Net loss for the year ended September 30, 2023, decreased by $3,981,654 to $9,310,588 from $13,292,242 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Total revenue for the period increased, as compared to total revenue in the same period last year, due to increased demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services and $2,316,000 of additional revenue from the business related to the acquisition of Heisey Mechanical. Net loss decreased due to the increase in revenue, an impairment of goodwill and the write-off of related party receivables in the prior year.\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Security segment revenues for the years ended September 30, 2023, increased by $10,538,706 or 44%, to $34,359,470 from $23,820,764 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase is due to an increased demand for security technology products under our Vicon brand.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur Industrial Services segment revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023, increased by $3,803,076 or 18%, to $25,009,092 from $21,206,016 for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase is mainly due to an increased demand for the segment&#8217;s products and services and $2,316,000 of additional revenue from the business related to the acquisition of Heisey Mechanical.\n\n&#160;\n\nGross Profit \n\n&#160;\n\nGross Profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, was $25,685,826 or 43% of revenues as compared to gross profit of $16,565,928 or 37% of revenues for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nGross profit in our Security segment was $17,106,300 or 50% of the segment&#8217;s revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to gross profit of $10,223,704 or 43% of the segment&#8217;s revenues for the year ended September 30, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, due to price increases implemented throughout the segment in January 2023 in response to rising costs of our goods and a reduction in transportation costs in 2023, compared to 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nGross profit in our Industrial Services segment was $8,579,526 or 34% of the segment&#8217;s revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to gross profit of $6,342,224 or 30% of the segment&#8217;s revenues for the year ended September 30, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, was primarily due to an increase in prices for our services and lower subcontractor costs.\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses \n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023, increased by $994,785 or 4% to $24,006,490 from $22,934,555 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to increases in salaries and wages, travel, and utilities.\n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development Expenses \n\n&#160;\n\nResearch and Development expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023, and 2022 were $3,267,994 and $4,444,488, respectively. The decrease in Research and Development expenses are primarily related to the Security Segment&#8217;s development of proprietary technology and next generation solutions associated with security and surveillance systems software which are nearing the production phase.\n\n&#160;\n\nOther Income/(Expense) \n\n&#160;\n\nOther income/(expense) for the year ended September 30, 2023, was $(4,489,605) as compared to $3,302,035 for the year ended 2022. Other income/(expense) for the year ended September 30, 2023, was mainly driven by interest expense on the Company&#8217;s debt and included an employee retention credit of $416,502. Other income/(expense) for the year ended September 30, 2022, included the following one-time items (i) the settlement with Securities and Exchange Commission, generated other expense of $2,200,000, (ii) other income resulting from the forgiveness of our PPP loans of $971,500. Additionally, the company had realized gains on marketable securities of $8,402,125.\n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 26 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Tax Benefit/(Expense) \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring the fiscal year of 2023 we recorded an income tax expense of $394,272 compared to a benefit of $208,545 for the fiscal year of 2022. The increase in the expense for income tax is mainly due to an increase in the net income of the industrial services segment compared to the prior year.\n\n&#160;\n\nEffects of Inflation \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented.\n\n&#160;\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\nWorking capital was $1,948,923 at September 30, 2023, compared to $6,252,972 at September 30, 2022. This includes cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $6,349,562 at September 30, 2023, and $11,473,676 at September 30, 2022, respectively. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to the decrease in the Company&#8217;s current assets of $2,474,726 and an increase in the Company&#8217;s current liabilities of $1,906,473. The primary reason for the decrease in current assets was the cash used for operations during the fiscal year and the decrease in assets of discontinued operations, while the primary reason for the increase in current liabilities was the increase in the Company&#8217;s accounts payable.\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating activities for continuing operations used $4,724,305 for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to using $16,262,531 of cash for the year ended September 30, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities for discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2023, was $2,491,581, compared to providing cash of $169,027 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nTrade receivables increased by $3,810,479 or 71% to $9,209,695 at September 30, 2023, from $5,399,216 at September 30, 2022. The increase in trade receivables is mainly due to increased revenues and receivables related to the business generated by the acquisition of Heisey.\n\n&#160;\n\nInvesting activities for continuing operations used $5,628,400 of cash during the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to $6,681,035 provided in the year ended September 30, 2022. Cash used by investing activities for discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2023, was $0, compared to using $70,908 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Investing activities for fiscal year 2023 were mainly driven by the purchase of property and equipment and the acquisition of Heisey Mechanical. Investing activities for fiscal year 2022 were mainly driven by the sale and purchase of marketable securities.\n\n&#160;\n\nFinancing activities provided $2,036,655 of cash for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $5,022,537 provided in the year ended September 30, 2022. In fiscal 2023 our financing activities were mainly comprised of financing of the acquisition of Heisey and the building purchase. In fiscal 2022 our financing activities were mainly comprised of the proceeds on new debt.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has incurred substantial losses of $9,196,875 and $13,020,958 for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, and has debt obligations over the next fiscal year of $14,507,711 and working capital of $1,948,923, that raise substantial doubt with respect to the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n&#160;\n\nWhile the Company&#8217;s working capital and current debt indicate a substantial doubt regarding the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern, the Company has historically, from time to time, satisfied and may continue to satisfy certain short-term liabilities through the issuance of common stock, thus reducing our cash requirement to meet our operating needs. Additionally, the Company has recently sold unprofitable brands, reducing the cash required to maintain those brands, implemented a new pricing model on our Vicon brand which has improved margins on those products, has refinanced some debt to provide the Company with additional capital when needed, has effected a reverse stock split on our common stock to remain trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets, and improve our ability to raise capital through equity offerings and reduce the number of shares the Company may use to satisfy debt. In the event additional capital is raised through equity offerings and/or debt is satisfied with equity, it may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. While the Company believes these plans are sufficient to meet the capital demands of our current operations for at least the next twelve months, the is no guarantee that we will succeed. \n\n&#160;\n\n", "item_7a": " ITEM 7A.
