MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\nDFP Holdings Limited (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 8, 2021, and has a fiscal year end of September 30. \n\n&#160; \n\nGOING CONCERN \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $714,332 and used cash in operations of $215,101. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that its financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company&#8217;s September 30, 2023, audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company&#8217;s financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement estimates that the current funds on hand will be sufficient to continue operations through the next six months. The Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement its business plan to increase its customer base and realize increased revenues. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing. \n\n&#160; \n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\n&#160; \n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES \n\n&#160; \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimates for assumptions used in impairment testing of long-term assets and the accrual of potential liabilities. \n\n&#160; \n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board&#8217;s (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, following the five-step model prescribed by ASC 606 , which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer, (2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the services it transfers to its clients. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 7 ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160; \n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\n2023: \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, we generated revenue of $1,216,130. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, operating expenses were $1,910,632, including cost of revenue of $188,658, general and administrative expenses of $909,960, general and administrative expenses to related party of $362,014 and impairment of prepaid application development fee to related party of $450,000, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\n2022: \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022, we generated revenue of $111,201. \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the period from December 8, 2021 (Inception) to September 30, 2022, operating expenses were $844,242, including cost of revenue of $41,540, general and administrative expenses of $37,366, general and administrative expenses to related party of $315,336 and impairment of prepaid application development fee to related party of $450,000, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160; \n\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $714,332 and used cash in operations of $215,101.
