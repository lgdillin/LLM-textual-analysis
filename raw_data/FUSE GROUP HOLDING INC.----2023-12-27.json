{"companyName": "FUSE GROUP HOLDING INC.", "filedAt": "2023-12-27T17:01:15-05:00", "item_1a": " ITEM 1A &#8211; RISK FACTORS \n\n&#160;\n\nAn investment in the Company &#8217; s common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the following risk factors, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed herein, and in other documents that the Company subsequently files with the SEC, that update, supplement or supersede such information for which documents are incorporated by reference into this Report. Additional risks not presently known to the Company, or which the Company considers immaterial based on information currently available, may also materially adversely affect the Company &#8217; s business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described herein occur, the Company &#8217; s business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, which could result in a decline in the market price of the Company &#8217; s common stock, causing you to lose all or part of your investment. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are a &#8220; smaller reporting company &#8221; and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe are currently a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, meaning we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $250 million and annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. Smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports.\n\n&#160;\n\nDecreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; may make it harder for investors to analyze the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial prospects.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe lack an operating history. There is no assurance our future operations will result in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, our business will fail. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe were incorporated on December 24, 2013, and as of September 30, 2023, we had accumulated a deficit of $7,909,019. We have a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Based upon current plans, we expect to continue generating revenues. However, our revenues may not be sufficient to cover our operating costs. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in generating significant revenues in the future. Failure to achieve a sustainable sales level will cause us to go out of business.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur success depends substantially on the continued retention of certain key personnel and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future to support our growth. \n\n&#160;\n\nIf our senior executive or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business may be disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We are dependent upon Mr. Umesh Patel, our chief executive officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and chief financial officer (&#8220;CFO&#8221;) and director. The loss of the service of Mr. Patel for any reason could significantly adversely impact our business and results of operations. Competition for senior management in the U.S. is intense and the pool of qualified candidates is very limited. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the services of our senior executive and other key personnel will continue to be available to us, or that we will be able to find a suitable replacement for them if they were to leave.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe face intense competition in our industry. If we are unable to compete successfully, our business will be seriously harmed. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe market for mining consulting services is highly competitive and has low barriers to entry. Our competitors vary in size and in the variety of services they offer. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, and an established client base. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sales of their services than we can, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. If we fail to compete successfully against our competitors, our revenue could decline and our business could be harmed.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe don &#8217; t have an audit committee. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nManagement determined our internal audit function is also deficient due to insufficient qualified resources to perform internal audits and we have not established an Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (&#8220;BOD&#8221;).\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company with limited resources. Currently, we do not have an audit committee and has not implemented appropriate information technology controls and is lack of sufficient accounting personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements as we have given priority in the use of the limited resources to the development of our business. Therefore, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;COSO&#8221;) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.\n\n&#160;\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#8217;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. For these reasons, we are considering the costs and benefits associated with improving and documenting our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, which includes (i) hiring additional personnel with sufficient U.S. GAAP experience and (ii) implementing ongoing training in U.S. GAAP requirements for our accounting and other finance personnel. If the result of these efforts are not successful, or if material weaknesses are identified in our internal control over financial reporting, our management will be unable to report favorably as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and/or our disclosure controls and procedures, and we could be required to further implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe do not have a majority of independent directors on our Board and the Company has not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. \n\n&#160;\n\nFederal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors&#8217; independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. We have not yet adopted any of these other corporate governance measures and since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur BOD is comprised of two individuals, one of whom is also our executive officer.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe have not adopted corporate governance measures such as an audit or other independent committee of our Board. If we expand our Board membership in future periods to include additional independent directors, we may seek to establish an audit and other committees of our Board. It is possible that if our BOD included independent directors and if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurance that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor example, at present in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages or employment contracts to our senior officers are made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. However, as a general rule, the Board, in making its decisions, determines first that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us that those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. The Company executes the transaction between executive officers and the Company once it was approved by the BOD.\n\n&#160;\n\nProspective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.\n\n&#160;\n\nLandbond Home Limited, our largest shareholder, will have control over key decision making as a result of its control of a substantial amount of our voting stock. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of December 26, 2023, Landbond Home Limited (&#8220;Landbond&#8221;), and its sole director, Mr. Yong Zhang, directly and indirectly owned 21,046,862 shares, or 31.7%, of our then outstanding common stock. Landbond&#8217;s beneficial ownership of 31.7% of our issued and outstanding common stock give it significant influence to the outcome of matters submitted to shareholders for approval in the future, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets. This concentrated ownership could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of their respective assets that other shareholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other shareholders do not support. This concentrated ownership could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock, due to the limited voting power of such shares. As a shareholder, even a major shareholder, Landbond is entitled to vote its shares in its own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our shareholders generally.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company is subject to the 15(d) reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which does not require a company to file all the same reports and information as fully reporting company. \n\n&#160;\n\nPursuant to Section 15(d), we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC, such as annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. That filing obligation will generally apply even if our reporting obligations have been suspended automatically under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act prior to the due date for the Form 10-K.\n\n&#160;\n\nOn the first day of any fiscal year after fiscal year 2016 and provided the Company has fewer than 300 shareholders, the Company is not required to file these reports. If the reports are not filed, the investors will have reduced visibility as to the Company and its financial condition. In addition, as a filer subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company is not required to prepare proxy or information statements; our common stock will not be subject to the protection of the going private regulations; the company will be subject to only limited portions of the tender offer rules; our officers, directors, and more than ten percent shareholders are not required to file beneficial ownership reports about their holdings in our company; that these persons will not be subject to the short-swing profit recovery provisions of the Exchange Act; and that more than five percent holders of classes of your equity securities will not be required to report information about their ownership positions in the securities.\n\n&#160;\n\nAn occurrence of an uncontrollable event such as the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively affect our operations and financial results. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported and has spread to multiple countries, including the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in the US.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur business and services and results of operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings have negatively impacted our business development, and disrupted or delayed our current mine projects and services to our clients during the outbreak. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nQuarantines, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place and other restrictions related to COVID-19 have impacted our abilities to visit mines in Mexico and Asian counties as well as meeting with potential clients and miner owners for our consulting business and our own investment in mine projects during the outbreak.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe global economy was materially negatively affected by COVID-19 and it is difficult to predict any new variants or outbreak of COVID-19, however, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the outbreak of a pandemic could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\n\n&#160;\n\nFurther, as we do not have access to a revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure commercial debt financing in the future in the event that we require additional capital. We currently believe that our financial resources will be adequate to see us through the next 12 months. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, the outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn general, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics, including, but not limited to, COVID-19, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A virus, the Ebola virus, or other outbreaks. In response to an epidemic or other outbreaks, government and other organizations may adopt regulations and policies that could lead to severe disruption to our daily operations, including temporary closure of our offices and other facilities. These severe conditions may cause us and/or our business partners to make internal adjustments, including but not limited to, temporarily closing down business, limiting business hours, and setting restrictions on travel and/or visits with clients and partners for a prolonged period of time. Various impacts arising from severe conditions may cause business disruption, resulting in material adverse effects to our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIf our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, our operating results could be harmed. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs a public company, we do and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the OTC Markets on which our common stock is traded. The expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically over the past several years. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs substantially and make some activities more time consuming and costly. If our costs and demands upon management increase disproportionately to the growth of our business and revenue, our operating results could be harmed.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe do not intend to pay dividends and there may be fewer ways in which you can make a gain on any investment in the Company. \n\n&#160;\n\nWe have never paid any cash dividends and currently do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may likely prohibit the payment of a dividend. Because we do not intend to declare dividends, any gain on an investment in the Company will need to come through appreciation of the stock&#8217;s price.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe may engage in future acquisitions involving significant expenditures of cash, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of stock, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would offer strategic growth opportunities. From time to time, we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in, and to acquire, businesses, products or technologies in the future. In the event of future acquisitions, we may expend significant cash, incur substantial debt and/or issue equity securities and dilute the percentage ownership of current shareholders, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and the price of our common stock. We cannot guarantee we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we may acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nThere is a very limited public market for our common stock and therefore, our investors may not be able to sell their shares. \n\n&#160;\n\nOur common stock is listed on the over-the-counter exchange, and is thinly traded. As a result, shareholders may be unable to liquidate their investments, or may encounter considerable delay in selling shares of our common stock. If an active trading market does develop, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile due to, among other things, the nature of our business and because we are a public company with a limited operating history. Further, even if a public market develops, the volume of trading in our common stock will presumably be limited and likely be dominated by a few individual shareholders. The limited volume, if any, will make the price of our common stock subject to manipulation by one or more shareholders and will significantly limit the number of shares that one can purchase or sell in a short period of time. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, most of which are beyond our control:\n\n&#160;\n\n- variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\n&#160;\n\n- changes in general economic conditions;\n\n&#160;\n\n- price competition or pricing changes by us or our competitors;\n\n&#160;\n\n- new services offerings or other actions by our competitors;\n\n&#160;\n\n- loss of a major customer, partner or joint venture participant; and\n\n&#160;\n\n- the addition or loss of key managerial and collaborative personnel.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe equity markets have, on occasion, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies&#8217; securities and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies.\n\n&#160;\n\nAny such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares, or may be forced to sell them at a loss.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nOur common stock was accepted for quotation on the OTCQB, as a result, the application of the &#8220; Penny Stock &#8221; rules could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and increase your transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has Rule 3A51-1, which establishes the definition of a &#8220; Penny Stock, &#8221; for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has market price of less than $5.00 per share or within an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, Rule 15G-9 require: \n\n&#160;\n\n- that a broker or dealer approve a person&#8217;s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\n&#160;\n\n- the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn order to approve a person&#8217;s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\n&#160;\n\n- obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\n&#160;\n\n- make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\n&#160;\n\n- sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\n&#160;\n\n- that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\n\n&#160;\n\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\n\n&#160;\n\n", "item_7": " ITEM 7 &#8211; MANAGEMENT &#8217; S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160;\n\nDISCLAIMER REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \n\n&#160;\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under the heading &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; and those set forth from time to time in our other filings with the SEC. \n\n&#160;\n\nOverview \n\n&#160;\n\nFuse Group Holding Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Fuse Group&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 24, 2013. Fuse Group currently develops opportunities in mining, biotech and consulting areas. On December 6, 2016, the Company incorporated Fuse Processing, Inc. (&#8220;Processing&#8221;) in the State of California. Processing seeks business opportunities in mining and is currently investigating potential mining targets in Asia and North America. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Processing. In March 2017, Processing acquired 100% ownership of Fuse Trading Limited (&#8220;Trading&#8221;) for HKD1 ($0.13). Trading had no operations prior to the acquisition by Processing, and Trading was expected to be engaged in mining-related businesses. On April 22, 2022, Processing transferred 100% ownership of Trading to an unrelated third party for HKD1. On May 3, 2018, the Company incorporated Fuse Technology Inc. in the State of Nevada, which changed its name to Fuse Biotech Inc. on November 30, 2020. Fuse Group is the sole shareholder of Fuse Biotech Inc. (&#8220;Fuse Biotech&#8221;). Fuse Biotech originally engaged in IMETAL system development. The Company originally planned to operate IMETAL as a platform to facilitate investment and trade in raw metals, find specialized minerals, exploit these opportunities and issue tokens to be used on the platform, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Due to the development of laws and regulations on token issuance and trading, management discussed its function and compliance issues with the designer of the platform and concluded the project had more issues and costs for compliance than originally expected, on December 23, 2019, the Board decided to terminate the IMETAL project. Currently, Fuse Biotech seeks business opportunities in the biotech area.\n\n&#160;\n\nFuse Group and Processing provide consulting services to mining industry clients to find acquisition targets within the parameters set by the clients, when the mine owner is considering selling its mining rights. The services of Fuse Group and Processing include due diligence on the potential mine seller and the mine, such as ownership of the mine and whether the mine meets all operation requirements and/or is currently in operation.\n\n&#160;\n\nOn January 4, 2017, Processing entered into a Consulting and Strategist Agreement with a consulting company for a six-month term. On July 3, 2017, Processing and the consulting company extended the Consulting and Strategist Agreement until January 3, 2018 at no additional cost, and the Agreement was subsequently extended to July 3, 2018. The consultant provides Processing with market research, exploration and advise on business development opportunities in certain countries, and other general business advisory services. Processing paid a deposit of $1,325,000 for the consulting fee, of which, $325,000 was expensed as a consulting fee based on the agreement, and the remaining $1,000,000 of which would have been refunded to the Company if the Company had not made an investment and/or entered into a business relationship in Mexico. The consulting company found acquisition targets for the Company, and on June 22, 2018, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with a seller to purchase concessions rights to five mineral locations located in different areas of Mexico for $1,000,000. Upon execution of the MOU, the Company acquired the exclusive right to purchase the concessions rights to mines from the seller until September 30, 2018. The parties entered into an oral agreement that the Company would pay a purchase price of $1,000,000 to purchase concessions rights to five mineral locations that would be consolidated into a local company in Mexico upon the approval from the Mexican government allowing the transfer of all mining concession to a Mexican company.\n\n&#160;\n\nOn February 9, 2021, the Company and Processing entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Choo Keam Hui, Goh Hau Guan, Lim Hui Sing, Teh Boon Nee and Tia Chai Teck (collectively as the &#8220;Sellers&#8221;). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to the Sellers in aggregate of 14,285,715 shares of common stock of the Company (the &#8220;Fuse Shares&#8221;) in exchange of all the outstanding shares of Portafolio en Investigacion Ambiental S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company (\"Portafolio&#8221;) owned by the Sellers. Portafolio owns concessions rights to five mineral locations and the five mines have not been explored and have no operations, no existing contracts for the sale of output, no permits or licenses to conduct mining operations. Portafolio only has five concessions to explore for minerals and owns no facilities or equipment. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the surface rights and permits that are necessary to extract the minerals from the areas covered by the concessions. The Company is waiting for the Sellers to complete the transfer process for the equity interest of Portafolio to the Processing to complete the transaction which is subject to the Mexican government approval and has not happened yet.\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nStock certificates for 14,285,715 shares were prepared by the Company for the closing of the transaction contemplated in the Agreement but were not delivered to the Sellers. After reevaluation of the Agreement, the Company determined that the transaction was incorrectly recorded, as such stock certificates remained in the custody of the Company and not delivered (i.e. provided as consideration) to the Sellers. On October 20, 2021, the Company cancelled these stock certificates.\n\n&#160;\n\nOn April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors (&#8220;BOD&#8221;) of the Company approved an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to change its name from Fuse Enterprises Inc. to Fuse Group Holding Inc. Also on April 29, 2019, stockholders holding a majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding capital stock approved the Amendment. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada on April 30, 2019, and became effective on May 13, 2019. On May 29, 2019, the Company changed its trading symbol on OTC Markets from FNST to FUST.\n\n&#160;\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in the US. Our business and services and results of operations were adversely affected. The pandemic negatively impacted our business development, and disrupted or delayed our mine projects and services to our clients. Quarantines, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place and other restrictions related to COVID-19 have impacted our abilities to visit mines in Mexico and Asian counties as well as to meet with potential clients and mine owners for our consulting business and our own investment in mine projects. Our clients that are negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may cancel or suspend their mine acquisition projects, which in turn will reduce their demands for our services and materially adversely impact our revenue. The businesses are back to normal in the U.S. and in California, however, the U.S. and global growth forecast are still uncertain, which would seriously affect people&#8217;s investment desires in mines in Mexico, Asia and internationally.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe received a $49,600 Paycheck Protection Program loan (&#8220;PPP loan&#8221;) and a $105,500 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (&#8220;EIDL loan&#8221;) from US Small Business Administration (&#8220;the SBA&#8221;) during the year ended September 30, 2020. The forgiveness of $49,600 PPP loan was approved in June 2021.\n\n&#160;\n\nOn March 11, 2021, Fuse Group and Fuse Biotech entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with E-Mo Biotech Holding Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Nevada (the &#8220;E-Mo Biotech&#8221;), Qiyi Xie, a resident of California (&#8220;Xie&#8221;), Quan Qinghua, a citizen and resident of China (&#8220;Quan&#8221;), Jing Li, a citizen and resident of China (&#8220;Li&#8221;) and HWG Capital Sdn Bhd, a company incorporated under laws of Malaysia (&#8220;HWG&#8221; and hereinafter collectively with Xie, Quan and Li, the &#8220;Sellers&#8221;). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will issue the Sellers 100,000,000 shares of Company&#8217;s common stock (the &#8220;Fuse Shares&#8221;) for all the issued and outstanding shares of E-Mo Biotech (the &#8220;E-Mo Shares&#8221;) owned by the Sellers. E-Mo Biotech Holding Inc. is a start-up, development-stage company involving in vaccine, immunological treatment and diagnostic product research and development and has no commercial sales of vaccines, treatments, or diagnostic products.

In addition to our own investment in mining businesses, we provide consulting services to clients which are mining business investors with potential mine acquisition targets within the specific parameters set by those clients, where the mine owner is considering selling its mining rights. Our services include due diligence on the potential mine seller and the mine, such as ownership of the mine and whether the mine meets all operation requirements and/or is currently in operation.\n\n&#160;\n\nOur revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 was nil.

We have explored and continue to explore options to obtain additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible courses of action. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which may result in dilution to existing shareholders), loans and cash advances from other third parties or banks, and other similar actions. There can be no assurance we will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through a sale of our common stock, loans from financial institutions, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed above. If we cannot sustain profitable operations, and additional capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business viability, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n&#160;\n\nCash Flows \n\n&#160;\n\nThe table below, for the periods indicated, provides selected cash flow information for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2023 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2022 \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net cash used in operating activities\n\n&#160; $ (439,770 )\n\n&#160; $ (449,844 )\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n\n&#160; &#160; 433,362 &#160; &#160; &#160; 347,337 &#160; Net decrease in cash\n\n&#160; $ (6,408 )\n\n&#160; $ (102,507 )\n\n##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities \n\n&#160;\n\nOur cash used in operating activities for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $439,770 and $449,844, respectively.
