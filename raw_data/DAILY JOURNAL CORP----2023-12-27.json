{"companyName": "DAILY JOURNAL CORP", "filedAt": "2023-12-27T20:43:46-05:00", "item_1a": " Item 1A. \n\nRisk Factors \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nThe foregoing business discussion and the other information included in this Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the following risks, trends and uncertainties, any of which, either individually or in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with a Public Health Event \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company &#8217; s business is likely to be materially and adversely affected by the emergence or resurgence of an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19, or by a similar event or the fear of such an event, and the measures that governmental authorities implement to address it. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs COVID-19 spread in early 2020, governmental authorities and health officials implemented numerous unprecedented measures to contain the virus, including &#8220;stay at home&#8221; orders for non-essential workers, travel restrictions, quarantines and business shutdowns. Most of Journal Technologies&#8217; customers, which are primarily courts and governmental agencies in the United States, Canada and Australia, either closed or significantly scaled back their activities. Similarly, many law firms and companies from which the Traditional Business derives advertising and subscription revenues also curtailed their operations and spending.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe impact on economic activity of a new crisis or a serious mutation of COVID-19 could again threaten the Traditional Business&#8217; advertising and subscription revenues. Most people again working from home and using on-line services would likely to put additional pressure on the newspaper business by impacting circulation numbers that may not be replaced by on-line revenues. Actions restricting travel, requiring non-essential workers to &#8220;stay at home&#8221; or causing courts and justice agencies to close or cut back operations can impact the ability of Journal Technologies to complete certain projects that are typically done in-person (and for which payment is usually received upon completion), reduce e-filing revenues, affect procurement processes and result in overall payment delays. In addition, the Company relies on its portfolio of marketable securities for dividend income and balance sheet support, and the value of the portfolio can be materially affected by declines in stock prices, particularly among the common stocks of the three U.S. financial institutions and one foreign manufacturer that make up a substantial portion of the portfolio.\n\n&#160;\n\nDue to the uncertainties associated with the duration and severity of an event like COVID-19, the efforts to contain it, and the changes in business operations and personal behaviors that are likely to follow from it, it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of its impact on the Company&#8217;s business in future periods, but it could materially affect the Company&#8217;s operations, staffing levels, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows going forward. Also, with new norms established, the majority of Journal Technologies employees continue working from home most days, and the long-term downsides of these new norms on innovation and productivity are still being determined.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 11 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with the Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technologies \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company &#8217; s business may be materially affected &#8212; either positively or negatively--by the emergence of disruptive new technologies or approaches enabled by the rapid pace of innovation unfolding in the artificial intelligence space. \n\n&#160;\n\nWorthwhile new technologies capitalize on eliminating old inefficiencies. Just as the emergence and maturation of the Internet and smartphone technologies had profound implications across many industries, AI has the potential to significantly change key factors related to the Traditional Business, Journal Technologies, and companies in the Company&#8217;s holdings of marketable securities.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor the Traditional Business, there may be opportunities to automate or reduce the cost of content creation, or perhaps allow monetization of existing and/or historic content in new ways. Likewise, AI may negatively impact the business in ways that will prove difficult to circumvent.\n\n&#160;\n\nFor Journal Technologies, AI may fundamentally alter or automate key customer workflows over time, obviating the need for its technology. AI will likely also create new and better ways for customers to achieve their mandates. We are allocating certain resources to ensure we have the capacity to recognize and pursue these opportunities, whether through in-house engineering, partnership, or mergers and acquisitions, but whether we will be successful is uncertain.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe process and approach to engineering software itself may change in notable ways, and this could impact the business model of Journal Technologies. Monitoring potential impacts of AI on companies in our holdings of marketable securities will also require attention.\n\n&#160;\n\nMitigating risk and capitalizing on potential opportunity requires active engagement. The Company&#8217;s challenge is to find and exploit opportunities to ensure change precipitated by AI provides tailwinds and not headwinds, and to do so in a way that is neither too slow, nor premature.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with the Traditional Business \n\n&#160;\n\nChanges in the legal requirement to publish public notice advertising or in the legal ability of our newspapers to publish those notices would have a significant adverse impact on The Traditional Business. \n\n&#160;\n\nFrom time to time, the legislatures in California and Arizona (and elsewhere) have considered various proposals that would result in the elimination or reduction of the amount of public notice advertising in printed newspapers required by statute, and Arizona approved one such proposal for a particular notice type in fiscal 2017. These proposals typically focus on the availability of alternative means of providing public notices, such as via the Internet. Some proposals also question the need for public notices at all. To the extent these proposals become law, particularly in California and Arizona, they could materially affect the revenues of the Traditional Business. \n\n&#160;\n\nFor example, the California legislature recently passed a bill (AB542) to be effective January 1, 2024 that will almost certainly result in a decline in legal advertising revenue by reducing the number of publication days in a newspaper for self-service storage facility lien sales. The existing requirement is to publish the notice once per week for two consecutive weeks. The bill now allows the notice to be published either once per week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper or once in a newspaper and once on an internet website that customarily conducts or advertises online auctions or sales. In time, this has the potential to reduce annual earnings by approximately $150,000 to $200,000 per year. Another bill (AB721) relative to school budget hearing notices, was also passed. Effective January 1, 2027 these notices are to be moved to posting on the school district&#8217;s website in lieu of being published in a newspaper.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 12 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nIn addition, if the adjudication, which is what gives publishers the legal ability to publish public notice advertising, of one or more of the Company&#8217;s newspapers were challenged and revoked, those newspapers would no longer be eligible to publish public notice advertising, and it could materially affect the revenues of the Traditional Business.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business faces strong competition in each of its markets. \n\n&#160;\n\nCompetition for readers and advertisers is very intense, both from established publications and from new entrants into the market. The Daily Journals face aggressive competition. The Company&#8217;s court rules publications face competition in both Northern and Southern California from document management programs, online court rules services, and the courts themselves. The steady decline in recent years in the number of subscriptions to The Daily Journals and the court rule publications is likely to continue and adversely impact the Traditional Business&#8217; future revenues.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business also competes with serious competitors for public notice advertising in all of its markets. As the amount of this advertising has decreased due to the reduction in the number of foreclosures discussed above, the competition to publish the remaining public notices has intensified and may result in a further decline in the Traditional Business&#8217; public notice advertising revenues.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business continues to experience challenges in maintaining its commercial advertising and circulation revenues, particularly due to the growth of Internet sites. \n\n&#160;\n\nInternet sites devoted to recruitment have become significant competitors of our newspapers and websites for classified advertising. In addition, there has been a steady consolidation of companies serving the legal marketplace, resulting in an ever-smaller group of companies placing display advertising. Furthermore, newspapers like ours have been struggling to compete for display advertising generally, given the many other forums (including Internet sites) that compete for advertising dollars. These trends are expected to continue and would adversely affect the Traditional Business.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, we had a slight increase of $9,000 in circulation revenues primarily resulting from some promotional sale efforts which we will continue. However, overall industry-wide circulation revenues have continued to decline as more and more information has become available online. Law firm mergers have also reduced the number of firms that purchase multiple subscriptions of our newspapers. It is not practical to assume that we will be able to offset the decline in subscriptions with increases in the subscription rate, and we cannot anticipate that our circulation revenues will continue to increase.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 13 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in postage and paper costs. \n\n&#160;\n\nAfter personnel costs, postage and paper costs are typically the Company&#8217;s next two largest expenses. An adequate supply of newsprint and other paper is important to the operations of the Traditional Business. The Company currently does not have a contract with any paper supplier, and in the past, shortages of newsprint have sometimes resulted in higher prices. Recently, there have been consolidations of newsprint suppliers, and paper prices may fluctuate substantially in the future.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business uses the U.S. Postal Service for distribution of a majority of its newspapers and products. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service and on legislative mandates imposed upon the U.S. Postal Service. During the past several years, postal rates have increased. Postal rates and fees may increase more in the future. Further, we may not be able to pass on increases in paper and postage costs to our customers.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe expect the Traditional Business to continue to suffer from significant secular decline. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe newspaper business has been experiencing significant secular decline for some time, and the Company&#8217;s Traditional Business has been no exception. The Company expects its Traditional Business to continue to decline in the years ahead, which could have a material negative impact upon the Company&#8217;s revenue, income and future prospects.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Journal Technologies \n\n&#160;\n\nThe success of Journal Technologies depends in large part on the technological update and upgrade of its software products. \n\n&#160;\n\nJournal Technologies&#8217; success depends on the continued improvement of its products, and the costs to update and upgrade those products consistently represent a large portion of Journal Technologies&#8217; expenses. There are many uncertainties in the process of courts and other justice agencies migrating to newer case management systems, including whether Journal Technologies&#8217; versions of these systems will find general acceptance and whether the modification of such systems can be done in a cost-effective manner. The costs to update and upgrade Journal Technologies&#8217; products are expensed as incurred and will impact earnings at least through the foreseeable future. To build out next-generation technology there is up-front investment required, which is now underway. Likewise, investment is required to improve existing technology to simplify the process of configuring, managing and updating systems. These investments are being made to both improve win rates and maximize the efficiency (ergo reduce costs, and increase margins) of building and deploying customer systems. The intention is to improve profitability, but if this development is not done effectively, it may not yield the expected competitive advantages or intended efficiencies.\n\n&#160;\n\nJournal Technologies faces significant competition from other case management software vendors. \n\n&#160;\n\nThere is significant competition among a limited number of companies to provide services and software to courts and other justice agencies, and some of these companies are much larger and have greater access to capital and other resources than Journal Technologies. Normally, the vendor is selected through a bidding process, and often the customers will express a preference for, or even require, larger vendors. An inability to successfully compete in this difficult market could materially affect the earnings of Journal Technologies. Likewise, specialized vendors in specific vertical markets may develop or continue to enhance specific solutions for certain customer types that are sufficiently focused and turnkey that Journal Technologies will struggle to compete with them.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 14 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe customers of Journal Technologies are public sector entities, which create special issues and risks. \n\n&#160;\n\nAlmost all of the customers of Journal Technologies are courts, justice agencies, and other government entities. Accordingly, we face special risks associated with governmental budget constraints, especially during stressful economic times, which could force government entities to defer or forego consulting services or even stop paying their annual software license and maintenance fees. In addition, we encounter risks related to a longer and more complicated sales cycle than exists for commercial customers, political issues related to resource allocation, administration turnover and preferences for internal case management solutions or for a particular vendor, complicated bidding procedures, and fluctuations in the demand for information technology products and services.\n\n&#160;\n\nJournal Technologies generally recognizes revenues for software installations only upon completion of the applicable services and customer acceptance of the software system. \n\n&#160;\n\nIn most cases, installation fees are not due until the customer has indicated its satisfaction with the installed system, and it has &#8220;gone live&#8221;. Accordingly, we do not recognize revenues for installation services or for most other consulting services until after the services have been performed and accepted. There are significant risks associated with our ability to complete our services to the satisfaction of our customers and to fulfill the requirements that entitle us to be paid. An inability to realize payment for services performed could materially affect the earnings of Journal Technologies. Additional costs may not be recoverable for historic projects with flexible scopes or scopes that are subject to interpretation, or projects that require adjustments due to technology changes that occur due to the passage of time.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe end-of-life process for legacy products and customer transitions to new products must be handled effectively. \n\n&#160;\n\nDisruptions that affect long-standing customer relationships can have negative reputational implications for Journal Technologies and that can affect its earnings.\n\n&#160;\n\nRisks Associated with Our Holdings of Marketable Securities \n\n&#160;\n\nA large portion of the Company &#8217; s assets is held in publicly traded securities, and the prices of those securities may decline. \n\n&#160;\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company held marketable securities worth approximately $303,128,000, with an unrealized gain for financial statement purposes of $137,716,000. While this portfolio has enabled the Company to borrow on favorable terms for acquisitions and to better compete for case management software opportunities that are usually limited to &#8220;large&#8221; firms, it is unusual for a public company to invest a significant amount of its available cash in the marketable securities of other public companies. The value of these securities could decline, which would adversely affect net income and shareholders&#8217; equity.\n\n&#160;\n\nAlso, as of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s holdings of marketable securities were concentrated in just eight companies. Accordingly, a significant decline in the market value of one or more of the Company&#8217;s holdings may not be offset by hypothetically better performance of other holdings. This concentration of risk may result in a more pronounced effect on net income and shareholders&#8217; equity.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 15 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe irreplaceable manager of our marketable securities portfolio passed away in November 2023. \n\n&#160;\n\nCharles T. Munger, the legendary investor of Berkshire Hathaway fame, has been a director of the Company for many decades, and has long managed the Company&#8217;s holdings of marketable securities. Mr. Munger passed away on November 28, 2023. Although the Board will work to ensure that the portfolio remains well-managed, it&#8217;s impossible to ever replace Mr. Munger. Given the loss of Mr. Munger, the Company does not expect the future financial performance of its marketable securities portfolio to rival its past performance.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company is required to recognize losses in a particular security for financial statement purposes even though the Company has not actually sold the security. \n\n&#160;\n\nUnder accounting rules that became effective in fiscal 2019, changes in the unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in the Company&#8217;s reported net income (loss), even though the Company has not actually realized any gain or loss by selling such marketable securities. Accordingly, changes in the market prices of the Company&#8217;s marketable securities can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s reported results for a particular period, even though those changes do not bear on the performance of the Company&#8217;s operating businesses.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for marketable securities that are not denominated in the United States Dollar. \n\n&#160;\n\nAt times, the Company may hold marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the United States Dollar. When it does, the Company may be at risk for significant fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates, which would affect the profitability of such marketable securities. The Company currently owns one such investment that is denominated in Hong Kong Dollars.\n\n&#160;\n\nGeneral Corporate Risks \n\n&#160;\n\nChanges in accounting guidance could have a significant effect on the Company &#8217; s reported financial results. \n\n&#160;\n\nPreparing consolidated financial statements requires the Company&#8217;s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies and the prevailing accounting guidance. The Company considers fair value measurement and disclosures, revenue recognition, accounting for software costs and income taxes to be critical accounting policies and estimates. A change in the accounting guidance with respect to one or more of these areas could materially affect the Company&#8217;s reported financial results.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs noted above, beginning in fiscal 2019, changes in unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities are included in the Company&#8217;s net income (loss) and thus may have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s reported results depending on the fluctuations of the prices of the marketable securities owned by the Company.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 16 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nWe cannot be sure that customer information and systems are fully protected against security breaches. &#160; \n\n&#160;\n\nJournal Technologies&#8217; software processes and stores customer information in the conduct of its business, including in some cases by utilizing cloud-based systems supplied by third-party vendors. Despite our efforts to maintain up-to-date security controls, it is possible that our system could be improperly used to access or misappropriate customer systems or information, including personally identifiable or other confidential information. A material security breach of this nature could harm our reputation, cause us to lose current and potential customers, require us to allocate more resources to information security, or subject us or our customers to liability, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, or both. The Traditional Business also operates certain websites that process and, in certain cases, store customer information. Minor security breaches were discovered on websites operated by the Traditional Business in early fiscal 2015 and again in November 2023, and although both incidents were remediated without loss of data or revenue, there can be no assurance that there will not be more material breaches in the future. Also, our insurance may not cover all of the costs that we may incur as a result of a material security breach. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting has been designed to provide management and the Board of Directors with reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. As a small company, we are not able to segregate duties to the extent we could if we had more people, and we have not sufficiently designed controls that support an effective assessment of our internal controls relating to the prevention of fraud and possible management override of controls. Further, the Company does not have an internal audit group, and has not engaged an outside firm to complete the documentation of its internal control assessment to the level required by the applicable criteria.\n\n&#160;\n\nWe believe that our overall internal control environment is sufficient for a company of our size. However, the existence of material weaknesses means that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we are not able to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely way, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms will be adversely affected. Such a result could negatively impact the market price and trading liquidity of our stock, weaken investor confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ", "item_7": " Item 7. \n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\n##TABLE_END &#160;\n\nResults of Operations \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company continues to operate as two different businesses: (1) The Traditional Business, being the business of newspaper publishing and related services that the Company had before 1999 when it purchased a software development company, and (2) Journal Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;Journal Technologies&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary which supplies case management software systems and related products to courts, prosecutor and public defender offices, probation departments and other justice agencies, including administrative law organizations, city and county governments and bar associations. These organizations use the Journal Technologies family of products to help manage cases and information electronically, to interface with other critical justice partners and to extend electronic services to the public, including e-filing and a website to pay traffic citations and fees online. These products are licensed or subscribed in approximately 30 states and internationally.\n\n&#160;\n\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic \n\n&#160;\n\nOn March 13, 2020, the United States declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a national emergency, and several states and municipalities also declared public health emergencies. Unprecedented actions were taken by public health and other governmental authorities to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, including &#8220;stay-at-home&#8221; orders and similar mandates that restricted the daily activities of individuals and limited the operation of businesses that were deemed &#8220;non-essential&#8221;. In addition, most of Journal Technologies&#8217; customers, which are primarily courts and governmental agencies in the United States, Canada and Australia, were either closed or significantly scaled back their activities. Similarly, many law firms and companies from which the Traditional Business derives advertising and subscription revenues also curtailed their in-person operations and spending.\n\n&#160;\n\nAlthough the World Health Organization has declared an end to the COVID-19 emergency, enduring changes in society resulting from efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have continuing effects on the Company&#8217;s business. For example, for Journal Technologies, there have been several delays or cancellations in government procurement processes. Also, although we were able to complete many existing projects remotely, we were delayed in finishing certain implementations and trainings because of our inability to work with clients in-person. Given that we are typically paid for implementation services upon &#8220;go-live&#8221; of a system, recognition of those revenues has been delayed. This can also create a risk of contract cancellations of in-progress projects, which has not been a common issue to date (although there were two in the past year), and Journal Technologies is working to minimize additional cancellations.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 20 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nReportable Segments \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s Traditional Business is one reportable segment and the other is Journal Technologies which includes Journal Technologies, Inc. and Journal Technologies (Canada) Inc. All inter-segment transactions were eliminated. Additional detail about each of the reportable segments and the Company's corporate income and expenses is set forth below:\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START Overall Financial Results (000)\n\n&#160; For the twelve months ended September 30\n\n&#160;

Total operating revenues for the Company&#8217;s software business were $51,456,000 and $38,087,000, of which $28,209,000 and $19,459,000, respectively, were recognized upon completion of services while $23,247,000 and $18,628,000, respectively, were recognized ratably over the subscription periods.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 21 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 \n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidated Financial Comparison \n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidated revenues were $67,709,000 and $54,009,000 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. This increase of $13,700,000 (25%) was primarily from increases in (i) Journal Technologies&#8217; consulting fees of $7,911,000, license and maintenance fees of $4,311,000 and other public service fees of $1,147,000, and (ii) the Traditional Business&#8217; advertising revenues of $364,000, partially offset by a decrease in the Traditional Business&#8217; advertising service fees and other of $42,000.\n\n&#160;\n\nApproximately 76% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during fiscal 2023 were derived from Journal Technologies, as compared with 71% in the prior fiscal year. In addition, the Company&#8217;s revenues have been primarily from the United States, with approximately $3,293,000 (5%) from foreign countries. Almost all of Journal Technologies&#8217; revenues are from governmental agencies.\n\n&#160;\n\nConsolidated operating expenses increased by $9,037,000 (17%) to $61,057,000 from $52,020,000. Total salaries and employee benefits increased by $6,970,000 (19%) to $43,450,000 from $36,480,000 primarily due to the annual salary adjustments and the hiring of additional staff members to strengthen operational efficiencies, product development, and bolster the teams working on the company&#8217;s installation projects. Outside services increased by $2,312,000 (52%) to $6,768,000 from $4,456,000 mainly because of additional contractor services and increased third-party hosting fees which were billed to clients. Equipment maintenance and software increased by $286,000 (28%) to $1,315,000 from $1,029,000 mainly resulting from increased maintenance costs and additional miscellaneous office and enterprise software license purchases. Other general and administrative expenses increased by $518,000 (15%) to $3,876,000 from $3,358,000 mainly because there were increased business travel expenses as compared to the prior fiscal year period.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s non-operating income, net of expenses, increased by $125,988,000 to $21,450,000 from a loss of $104,538,000 in the prior fiscal year primarily because of (i) the recording of net unrealized gains on marketable securities of $17,024,000 as compared with net unrealized losses of $123,401,000 in the prior fiscal year, and (ii) increases in dividends and interest income of $2,885,000 (53%) to $8,356,000 from $5,451,000. These increases were partially offset by (i) the recording of realized net gains on sales of marketable securities of $422,000 during fiscal 2023 as compared with $14,249,000 in the prior fiscal year, (ii) increases in interest expenses of $3,229,000 (315%) to $4,255,000 from $1,026,000 primarily due to the federal interest rate increases, and (iii) gains of $272,000 on a partial land sale associated with the City of Logan&#8217;s street widening project during fiscal 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company&#8217;s consolidated pretax income was $28,102,000, as compared to pretax loss of $102,549,000 in the prior fiscal year. There was consolidated net income of $21,452,000 ($15.58 per share) for fiscal 2023, as compared with consolidated net loss of $75,624,000 (-$54.81 per share) in the prior fiscal year.\n\n&#160;\n\nAt September 30, 2023, the aggregate fair market value of the Company&#8217;s marketable securities was $303,128,000. These securities had approximately $137,716,000 of net unrealized gains before taxes of $36,260,000. They generated approximately $8,336,000 in dividends and interest income during fiscal 2023, as compared with $5,451,000 in the prior fiscal year. Most of the unrealized gains were in the common stocks of three U.S. financial institutions and one foreign manufacturer.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 22 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nTaxes \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $6,650,000 on pretax income of $28,102,000. The income tax provisions consisted of tax provisions of $110,000 on the realized gains on marketable securities, $4,140,000 on the unrealized gain on marketable securities, and $2,803,000 on operating income, partially offset by a tax benefit of $403,000 for the dividends received deduction and other permanent differences. Consequently, the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.7%, after including the taxes on the realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $26,925,000 on the pretax loss of $102,549,000. The income tax benefit consisted of a tax benefit of $32,840,000 on the unrealized losses on marketable securities and a benefit of $340,000 for the dividends received deduction and other permanent book and tax differences, offset by tax provisions of $3,790,000 on the realized gains on marketable securities, $1,735,000 on income from operations, and $730,000 for the effect of a change in state apportionment on the beginning of the year&#8217;s deferred tax liability. Consequently, the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 26.3%, after including the taxes on the realized gains and unrealized losses on marketable securities.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company files consolidated federal income tax returns in the United States and with various state jurisdictions and is no longer subject to examinations for fiscal years before fiscal 2019 with regard to federal income taxes and fiscal 2018 for state income taxes.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business&#8217; pretax income increased by $1,682,000 (240%) to $2,384,000 from $702,000 in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a reduced long-term supplemental compensation accrual of $1,600,000 (142%) to a reduction of $470,000 from an addition of $1,130,000 in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by increased personnel costs of $798,000 to $10,416,000 from $9,618,000.\n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Traditional Business had total operating revenues of $16,253,000, as compared with $15,922,000 in the prior fiscal year. Advertising revenues increased by $364,000 (4%) to $8,955,000 from $8,591,000, primarily resulting from increased trustee sale notice advertising revenues of $207,000 (mainly because of the lifting of COVID-related foreclosure moratoriums on lenders), legal notice advertising revenues of $53,000, government notice advertising revenues of $44,000 and commercial advertising revenues of $60,000.\n\n&#160;\n\nTrustee sale notices are very much dependent on the number of California and Arizona foreclosures for which public notice advertising is required by law. The number of foreclosure notices published by the Company increased by 22% during fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The Company&#8217;s smaller newspapers, those other than the Los Angeles and San Francisco Daily Journals (&#8220;The Daily Journals&#8221;), accounted for about 88% of the total public notice advertising revenues during fiscal 2023. Public notice advertising revenues and related advertising and other service fees, including trustee sales legal advertising revenues, constituted about 14% of the Company's total operating revenues for fiscal 2023 and 17% for fiscal 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 23 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Daily Journals accounted for about 93% of the Traditional Business&#8217; total circulation revenues, which increased by $9,000 to $4,403,000 from $4,394,000. The court rule and judicial profile services generated about 5% of the total circulation revenues, with the other newspapers and services accounting for the balance. Advertising service fees and other are Traditional Business segment revenues, which include primarily (i) agency commissions received from outside newspapers in which the advertising is placed, and (ii) fees generated when filing notices with government agencies.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Traditional Business segment operating expenses, excluding the adjustments to the long-term supplemental compensation accrual, increased by $249,000 (2%) to $14,339,000 from $14,090,000, primarily resulting from the annual salary adjustments.\n\n&#160;\n\nJournal Technologies \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, Journal Technologies&#8217; business segment pretax income increased by $2,981,000 (232%) to $4,268,000 from $1,287,000 in the prior fiscal year primarily resulting from increased revenues of $13,369,000, partially offset by increased operating expenses of $10,388,000.\n\n&#160;\n\nRevenues increased by $13,369,000 (35%) to $51,456,000 from $38,087,000 in the prior fiscal year. Licensing and maintenance fees increased by $4,311,000 (22%) to $23,503,000 from $19,192,000. Consulting fees increased by $7,911,000 (67%) to $19,776,000 from $11,865,000 mainly resulting from more project go-lives (i.e. signoffs by the clients). Other public service fees increased by $1,147,000 (16%) to $8,177,000 from $7,030,000 primarily because of increased e-filing fee revenues.\n\n&#160;\n\nDeferred consulting fees primarily represent advances from customers of Journal Technologies for installation services and are recognized upon final project go-lives. Deferred revenues on license and maintenance contracts represent prepayments of annual license and maintenance fees and are recognized ratably over the maintenance periods.\n\n&#160;\n\nOperating expenses increased by $10,388,000 (28%) to $47,188,000 from $36,800,000 primarily because of (i) increased personnel costs because of salary adjustments due to recent inflation in the compensation market for talent, (ii) additional contractor services and the hiring of additional staff members to strengthen operational efficiencies, product development, and bolster the teams working on the c ompany&#8217;s installation projects, (iii) increased third-party hosting fees which were billed to clients and (iv) increased business travel expenses.\n\n&#160;\n\nJournal Technologies continues to update and upgrade its software products. These costs are expensed as incurred and will impact earnings at least through the foreseeable future.\n\n&#160;\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n&#160;\n\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable security positions increased by $35,269,000, after the sales of marketable securities of approximately $2,826,000, and the recording of net pretax unrealized gains on marketable securities of $17,024,000. Cash, cash equivalents, and the proceeds from the sales of marketable securities were primarily used to purchase additional marketable securities of $10,001,000.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe investments in marketable securities, which had an adjusted cost basis of approximately $165,412,000 and a market value of about $303,128,000 at September 30, 2023, generated approximately $8,336,000 in dividends and interest income during fiscal 2023. These securities had approximately $137,716,000 of net unrealized gains before estimated taxes of $36,260,000 which will become due only when we sell securities in which there is unrealized appreciation. The balance on the Company's margin loan secured by the securities portfolio was $75,000,000 at both September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 24 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCash flows from operating activities increased by $20,345,000 during fiscal 2023, as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to (i) decreases in the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable of $5,651,000 mainly resulting from more collections, its income tax receivable of $2,038,000 and its deferred tax benefit of $36,144,000 and (ii) increases in net accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $230,000 (because of the timing difference in remitting e-filing fees to the courts), deferred revenues of $1,434,000 and income tax payable of $7,313,000. This was partially offset by decreases in net income of $32,228,000, excluding the increases in unrealized gains on marketable securities of $140,425,000; decreases in realized net gains on sales of marketable securities of $13,827,000; additional stock dividends of $2,978,000; and prior year&#8217;s gains of $272,00 on land sale associated with Logan City&#8217;s street widening project.\n\n&#160;\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had working capital of $303,207,000, including the liabilities for deferred subscriptions, deferred consulting fees and deferred maintenance agreements and others of $25,539,000.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company believes that it will be able to fund its operations for the foreseeable future through its cash flows from operations and its current working capital and expects that any such cash flows will be invested in its businesses. The Company may or may not have the ability to borrow additional amounts against its marketable securities and, among other possibilities, it may be required to consider selling some of those securities to generate cash if needed to fund ongoing operations. The amount available for borrowing is based on the market value of the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio and fluctuates depending on the value of the underlying securities. In addition, the Company could be subject to margin calls should the balance of the investment decrease significantly. \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company is not a smaller version of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Indeed, given the passing of Mr. Munger, the Company does not expect its holdings of marketable securities to generate gains in the future consistent with the past. The Company&#8217;s goal is simply to continue to develop a successful and profitable software business, while continuing to enjoy the benefit of its Traditional Business for as long as possible. \n\n&#160;\n\n- 25 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#8217;s application of accounting policies. Management believes that revenue recognition, accounting for software costs, fair value measurement and disclosures (including the long-term Incentive Plan liabilities) and income taxes are critical accounting policies and estimates.\n\n&#160;\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC Topic 606) .\n\n&#160;\n\nFor the Traditional Business, proceeds from the sale of subscriptions for newspapers, court rule books and other publications and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the services are provided, generally over the subscription term. Advertising revenues are recognized when advertisements are published.\n\n&#160;\n\nJournal Technologies' contracts may include several products and services, which are generally distinct and include separate transaction pricing and performance obligations. Most are one-transaction contracts. These current subscription-type contract revenues include (i) implementation consulting fees to configure the system to go-live, (ii) subscription software license, maintenance (including updates and upgrades) and support fees, and (iii) third-party hosting fees when used. Revenues for consulting are generally recognized at point of delivery (go-live) upon completion of services. These contracts include assurance warranty provisions for limited periods and do not include financing terms. For some contracts, the Company acts as a principal with respect to certain services, such as data conversion, interfaces and hosting that are provided by third-parties, and recognizes such revenues on a gross basis. For legacy contracts with perpetual license arrangements, licenses and consulting services are recognized at point of delivery (go-live), and maintenance revenues are recognized ratably after the go-live. Other public service fees are earned and recognized as revenues when the Company processes credit card payments on behalf of the courts via its websites through which the public can e-file cases and pay traffic citations and other fees.\n\n&#160;\n\nASC 985-20, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed , provides that costs related to the research and development of a new software product are to be expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product is established. Accordingly, costs related to the development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are capitalized, subject to expected recoverability. In general, &#8220;technological feasibility&#8221; is achieved when the developer has established the necessary skills, hardware and technology to produce a product and a detailed program design has been (i) completed, (ii) traced to the product specifications and (iii) reviewed for high-risk development issues. The Company believes its process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility, and accordingly, no software development costs have been capitalized to date.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 26 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures , requires the Company to (i) disclose the amounts of transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of Level 3 measurements. This guidance also provides clarification of existing disclosures requiring the Company to determine each class of its investments based on risk and to disclose the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both Level 2 and Level 3 measurements. The Company made no transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements in fiscal years 2023 and 2022. During that time all of the Company&#8217;s investments have been quoted on public markets and, therefore, all fair value calculations have been based on Level 1 measurements. The estimated Incentive Plan&#8217;s future commitment is calculated using Level 3 inputs, based on an average of the prior fiscal year (fiscal 2022) and the current year&#8217;s pretax earnings before certain items, discounted to the present value at 6% since each granted Incentive Plan Unit will expire over its remaining life term of up to 10 years.\n\n&#160;\n\nASC 740, Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. This accounting guidance also prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company&#8217;s financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company&#8217;s financial position or its results of operations and its deferred tax liabilities related to the unrealized net gains on investments. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n&#160;\n\nASC 280-10, Segment Reporting , defines an operating segment as a component of a public entity that has discrete financial information that is evaluated regularly by the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer to decide how to allocate resources and to assess performance. In accordance with ASC 280-10, the Company has two reportable business segments which are: (i) the Traditional Business and (ii) Journal Technologies and Journal Technologies (Canada).\n\n&#160;\n\nThe above discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report.\n\n&#160;\n\n- 27 -\n\n&#160;\n\n&#160;\n\n##TABLE_START ", "item_7a": ""}
