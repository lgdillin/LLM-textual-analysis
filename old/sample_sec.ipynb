      "Following a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. Central to this strategy was the purchase of land in LaFayette, GA and the entry into a favorable contract for electricity in the second quarter of 2019. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts (MW) of low-cost power. \n",

      "The Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company (“Bitmain”), and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph/s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Company’s miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Company’s current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW. The entire facility, including the land, two 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, the mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. As the Company is presently using only a portion of the built-out available electrical load, it is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations including but not limited to further equipment sales, leasing space to other Bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newest generation miners. \n",

We also entered into management agreements with third party investors whereby the investors purchased the mining hardware, and we received both a fee to manage the mining operations plus one-half of the net operating profit. In March 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to terminate our hosting agreement in Washington and conveyed ownership of its onsite mining assets for full satisfaction of $77 in outstanding hosting service fees. In August and September 2019, we terminated all our management agreements with third party investors, and in December 2019, we terminated our final remaining hosting arrangements in Colorado and Ohio. \n",

The notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates. \n",

We derive our revenue by solving “blocks” to be added to the blockchain and providing transaction verification services within the digital currency network of Bitcoin, commonly termed “cryptocurrency mining.” In consideration for these services, we receive digital currency (“Coins”). The Coins are recorded as revenue, using the average spot price of Bitcoin on the date of receipt. The Coins are recorded on the balance sheet as an intangible digital asset valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value adjustments, to adjust the value of Coins to market value, is included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statement of operations. Further, any gain or loss on the sale of Coins would be recorded to costs of revenue. Costs of revenue include hosting fees, equipment and infrastructure depreciation, net realizable value adjustments, and electricity costs. \n",

We received a fee from each management agreement based on the amount of Bitcoin mined, half of profits and were reimbursed for any electricity costs incurred to run the Bitcoin mining machines they managed in their facilities. Additionally, we had machines located in hosted facilities in Ohio and Colorado. We received an allocation of profits from these facilities.

The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Deposits on property and equipment are initially classified as Other Assets and upon delivery, installation and full payment, the assets are classified as property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. \n",

If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete. \n",

As a result, financial instruments (or embedded conversion features) with down round features are not required to be classified as derivative liabilities. The Company recognizes the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered and the exercise or conversion price has been adjusted downward. For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments, such as warrants, the Company treats the value of the effect of the down round, when triggered, as a deemed dividend and a reduction of income available to common stockholders in computing basic earnings per share. For convertible instruments with embedded conversion features containing down round provisions, the Company recognizes the value of the down round as a beneficial conversion discount to be amortized to earnings. \n",

When it is determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the host contract, and (ii) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a financial derivative instrument, then the embedded feature is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument. The estimated fair value of the derivative feature is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets separately from the carrying value of the host contract.

In light of broader macro-economic risks and already known impacts on certain industries, we have taken, and continue to take targeted steps to lower our operating expenses because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations closely and this situation could change based on a significant number of factors that are not entirely within our control and are discussed in this and other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K. To date, travel restrictions and border closures have not materially impacted our ability to operate. However, if such restrictions become more severe, they could negatively impact those activities in a way that would harm our business over the long term. Travel restrictions impacting people can restrain our ability to operate, but at present we do not expect these restrictions on personal travel to be material to our business operations or financial results. Like most companies, we have taken a range of actions with respect to how we operate to assure we comply with government restrictions and guidelines as well as best practices to protect the health and well-being of our employees. We have also undertaken measures to reduce our administrative and advisory costs required as a publicly reporting company.

The PPP Loan bears interest at 1% per annum, with monthly installments of $6 commencing on November 1, 2021 for 18 months through its maturity on April 1, 2023. The principal amount of the PPP Loan will be forgiven if the loan proceeds are used to pay for payroll costs, rent and utilities costs over the 24-week period after the PPP Loan is made. Not more than 40% of the forgiven amount may be used for non-payroll costs. The amount of the loan forgiveness may be reduced if the Company reduces its full-time head count. On April 1, 2021, the Company received notice of forgiveness in the amount of $108 in relation to the PPP Loan. The Company used all proceeds from the PPP Loan to maintain payroll and other allowable expenses. As a result, management believes that the Company has met the PPP eligibility criteria for forgiveness for the remaining payable of $3 to the SBA and has concluded that the loan represents, in substance, a government grant that is expected to be forgiven in its entirety. \n",
