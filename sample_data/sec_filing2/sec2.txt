Overview
Business Overview
We are a pioneer and leader in conversational and cognitive AI innovations that bring intelligence to everyday work and life. Our solutions and technologies can understand, analyze and respond to human language to increase productivity and amplify human intelligence. Our solutions are used by businesses in the healthcare, financial services, telecommunications and travel industries, among others. We see several trends in our markets, including (i) the growing adoption of cloud-based, connected services and highly interactive mobile applications, (ii) deeper integration of virtual assistant capabilities and services, and (iii)
the continued expansion of our core technology portfolio including automated speech recognition, natural language understanding, semantic processing, domain-specific reasoning, dialog management capabilities, AI, and voice biometric speaker authentication. We report our business in three segments, Healthcare, Enterprise, and Other.
•Healthcare. Our healthcare segment provides intelligent systems that support a more natural and insightful approach to clinical documentation, freeing clinicians to spend more time caring for patients and helping care teams and health organizations drive meaningful financial and clinical outcomes. Our principal solutions include Dragon Medical Cloud-based solutions, Computer-Assisted Physician Documentation, Diagnostic Imaging Solutions, Nuance® Dragon Ambient eXperience™, Clinical Documentation Improvement and Coding.
•Enterprise. Our Enterprise segment is a leading provider of AI-powered intelligent customer engagement solutions and services, which enable enterprises and contact centers to enhance and automate customer service and sales engagement. Our principal solutions include interactive voice response, intelligent engagement, digital messaging and security & biometric solutions, delivered via on-premise and/or cloud.
•Other. Our Other segment currently consists primarily of voicemail transcription services.
•Discontinued Operations. On November 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement (the "Agreement") to sell our medical transcription and electronic healthcare record ("EHR") implementation businesses (the "Business"). On March 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the Business and received proceeds of approximately $29.8 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. For all periods presented, the Businesses' results of operations have been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. by Microsoft Corporation
On April 11, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Microsoft. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft has agreed to acquire Nuance for $56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following consummation of the Merger, Nuance will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of $515.0 million. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The Merger is currently expected to close by the end of our first quarter or early in our second quarter of fiscal year 2022.
For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the definitive proxy statement previously filed with the SEC and other relevant materials in connection with the transaction that we will file with the SEC and that will contain important information about Nuance and the Merger.

The decrease in interest expense was due to redemptions of $521.9 million notional amounts of the 1.0% and 1.5% Convertible Debentures during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, holders of our 1.0% and 1.5% Convertible Debentures exercised their right to convert $226.6 million notional amount during fiscal year 2021.
The increase of other expense, net was primarily due to losses on conversions and redemptions of debt in fiscal year 2021.
Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019
The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower yields and the decreases in cash and marketable securities for the current year period.
The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the repayments of $300.0 million of the 2020 Senior Notes in March 2019 and $300.0 million of the 2024 Senior Notes in October 2019, as well as the repurchases of $123.8 million notional amounts of the 1.25% and 1.5% Convertible Debentures during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
The increase of other expense, net was primarily due to losses on redemption and repurchases of debt in fiscal year 2020, offset
in part by higher gains on foreign currency transactions.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
The following table shows the provision (benefit) for income taxes on continuing operations and the effective income tax rate (dollars in millions):
Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2019 % Change 2021 vs. 2020 % Change 2020 vs. 2019
Provision (benefit) for income taxes
$ 5.4 $ (30.9) $ (23.2) (117.5) % 33.1 %
Effective income tax rate (45.2) % 70.3 % 35.8 %
The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the geographic mix of our income, the composition of the income in different countries, changes relating to valuation allowances and the potential tax consequences of resolving audits or other tax contingencies.
Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020
The effective income tax rate in fiscal year 2021 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to a change in the valuation allowance in the United States as well as the addition of uncertain tax positions partially offset by base erosion and anti-abuse planning initiatives.
Provision for income taxes increased by $36.3 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to a net $29.9 million deferred tax benefit from adjustments to domestic valuation allowance primarily related to the Cerence spin-off and a foreign tax benefit of $14.8 million related to fiscal year 2019 intangible property transfers offset by base erosion and anti-abuse planning initiatives.
Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019
The effective income tax rate in fiscal year 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to a net $29.9 million deferred tax benefit from adjustments to domestic valuation allowance primarily related to the Cerence spin-off, a foreign tax benefit of $14.8 million related to prior year intangible property transfers, offset in part by uncertain tax positions of $17.1 million and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax of $4.3 million.
Benefit for income taxes increased by $7.7 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to a $29.9 million net deferred tax benefit from adjustments to the domestic valuation allowance primarily related to the Cerence spin-off.
Valuation Allowances
As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, we had a full valuation allowance against net domestic deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the release of all or some portion of these allowances. A significant portion of our domestic deferred tax assets relate to U.S. net operating losses. We continue to believe negative evidence for the release of some or all of the allowances outweighs positive evidence after considering recent profitability trends and the disposition of the medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses. We continue to evaluate all sources of domestic taxable income including both the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood that we could sustain pretax profitability in the future. As of September 30, 2021, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next twelve months these sources of taxable income may become sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that a substantial portion of the domestic valuation allowance, excluding capital losses, could be released.
Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations
Disposition of Our Medical Transcription and EHR Implementation businesses
On November 17, 2020, we entered into the Agreement to sell the Business to Assured Healthcare Partners and Aeries Technology Group (together, the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the Agreement, we sold and transferred, and the Buyer purchased and acquired, (a) the shares of certain subsidiaries through which we operate a portion of the Business and (b) certain assets used in or related to the Business; and the Buyer assumed certain liabilities related to such assets of the Business, subject to certain exclusions and indemnities as set forth in the Agreement.
On March 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the Business and received approximately $29.8 million in cash, subject to post-closing finalization of the adjustments set forth in the Agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss of $12.5 million, which is included within net (loss) income from discontinued operations. There are a number of working capital and other adjustments under the Agreement and related ancillary agreements. We do not believe that post-closing working capital adjustments under the Agreement, if any, will have a material impact on our results of operations.
For all periods presented, the Businesses' results of operations have been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.

These revenues are included to allow for more complete comparisons to the financial results of historical operations and in evaluating management performance.
Segment Revenues
Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020
•Healthcare segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 increased by $85.9 million, or 11.9%, driven primarily by growth in the Dragon Medical and CAPD cloud offerings. Revenue from Dragon Medical cloud and DAX cloud-based solutions increased by $78.3 million, or 28.0%, to $358.4 million for fiscal year 2021 from $280.1 million for fiscal year 2020, primarily due to the continued market penetration and customer transition to DMO.
•Enterprise segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 increased by $5.4 million, or 1.0%, primarily due to the growth in our Security and Biometrics solutions.
•Other segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 decreased by $13.0 million, or 38.3%, as we continue to wind down our Other segment.
Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019
•Healthcare segment revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased by $19.7 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to the growth in Dragon Medical and DAX cloud-based solutions.
•Enterprise segment revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased by $19.2 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to the growth in digital engagement solutions.
•Other segment revenue for fiscal year 2020 decreased by $27.6 million, or 44.9%, due to the wind-down of Devices and the sale of our Mobile Operator Services business in fiscal year 2019.
Segment Profit
Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020
•Healthcare segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased by $35.4 million, or 15.4%, primarily driven by revenue growth in the Dragon Medical, CAPD, and CDI cloud offerings. Segment profit margin increased by 1.0 percentage points to 32.9%, primarily driven by growth in our Dragon Medical cloud-based solution, which is margin accretive.
•Enterprise segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 decreased by $7.1 million, or 4.9%, as higher segment revenue was more than offset by higher operating expenses. Segment profit margin decreased by 1.6 percentage points to 25.7%, primarily due to higher operating expenses, which was only partially offset by higher segment revenues.
•Other segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 decreased by $8.4 million, or 42.5%, as we continue to wind down our Other segment. Segment profit margin decreased by 4.0 percentage points to 54.1%.
Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019
•Healthcare segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased by $22.9 million, or 9.1%, primarily due to higher R&D and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by higher revenue and gross margin improvement. Gross margin increased primarily due to a favorable shift in mix to higher margin Dragon Medical cloud-based solution. The increases in R&D and sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to higher spend to support the development and launch of new products and solutions. As a result, segment profit margin decreased by 4.2 percentage points to 31.9%.
•Enterprise segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased by $17.6 million, or 13.8%, primarily due to higher segment revenue and gross margin, offset in part by higher R&D and sales expenses. Gross margin improvement was primarily driven by a favorable shift in revenue mix towards higher-margin license revenue. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to higher spend on core technologies to support future growth. The increase in sales expense was primarily driven by higher commission costs due to higher bookings, offset in part by lower travel and entertainment expenses during the pandemic. As a result, segment profit margin increased by 2.4 percentage points to 27.3%.
•Other segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased by $0.3 million, or 1.5%, primarily driven by lower expense profile of the remaining business, offset in part by lower revenue. As a result, segment profit margin increased by 26.5 percentage points to 58.1%
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
We had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $209.5 million as of September 30, 2021, a decrease of $162.9 million from $372.3 million as of September 30, 2020. Our working capital, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities of continuing operations, was $(324.8) million as of September 30, 2021, compared to $(256.5) million as of September 30, 2020. Our working capital included $373.0 million and $432.2 million convertible debt as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, we had $298.1 million available for borrowing under our revolving
credit facility. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to support our operating needs, capital requirements and any debt service requirements for the next twelve months.
Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our international operations totaled $35.7 million as of September 30, 2021 and $60.9 million as of September 30, 2020. We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available to meet our liquidity needs. We expect the cash held overseas to be permanently invested in our international operations, and our U.S. operation to be funded through its own operating cash flows, cash and marketable securities within the U.S., and if necessary, borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
Acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. by Microsoft Corporation
On April 11, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Microsoft. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft has agreed to acquire Nuance for $56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following consummation of the Merger Nuance will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, but it is currently expected to close by the end of our first quarter or early in our second quarter of fiscal year 2022.
For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the definitive proxy statement previously filed with the SEC and other relevant materials in connection with the transaction that we will file with the SEC and that will contain important information about Nuance and the Merger.
Disposition of Our Medical Transcription and EHR Implementation Businesses
In connection with our ongoing comprehensive portfolio and business review, on November 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses.
On March 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the Business and received approximately $29.8 million in cash, subject to post- losing finalization of the adjustments set forth in the Agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss of $12.5 million, which is included within Net (loss) income from discontinued operations. There are a number of working capital and other adjustments under the Agreement and related ancillary agreements. We do not believe that post-closing working capital adjustments under the Agreement, if any, will have a material impact on our results of operations.
Convertible Debentures
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of 130% of the applicable conversion price per share for each of our convertible debentures for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending September 30, 2021. As a result, the holders of our 1.25% 2025 Debentures and 1.0% 2035 Debentures have the right to convert all or any portion of their debentures between October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Additionally, on November 5, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 1.5% 2035 Debentures. All three convertible notes, with a total net book value of $373.0 million, were included within current liabilities as of September 30, 2021.
Should any holders elect to convert, the principal amount of the convertible debentures would be payable in cash, and any amount payable in excess of the principal amount would be paid in cash or shares of our common stock at our election. During fiscal year 2021, holders of our 1.5% 2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert $137.4 million notional amount for $137.4 million in cash and 4.1 million shares of common stock, and holders of our 1.0% 2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert $89.2 million notional amount for $89.2 million in cash and 2.1 million shares of common stock. Additionally, during fiscal year 2021, we induced the exchange of $457.0 million notional amount of our 1.0% 2035 Debentures for $5.0 million in cash and 18.9 million shares of common stock, and $64.9 million notional amount of our 1.5% 2035 Debentures for $0.5 million in cash and 3.2 million shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2021, $130.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.0% 2035 Debentures and $25.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.5% 2035 Debentures remained outstanding.
Our convertible debentures are actively traded in the open market. The 1.25% 2025 Debentures trade at a price consistently in excess of their conversion values. Therefore, we believe that it is uneconomic, and thus unlikely, for the holders of the 1.25% 2025 Debentures to early exercise their conversion rights. In the event that holders of any of our debentures presented an amount for settlement that exceeded our then available sources of liquidity, we may need to obtain additional financing, which we believe would be available to us based upon our assessment of the prevailing market and business conditions and our experience of successful capital raising activities.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was $247.6 million, a decrease of $6.9 million from $254.6 million cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to:
•A decrease of $53.5 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations; and
•A decrease of $30.6 million from changes in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue had a negative effect of $9.3 million on operating cash flows for fiscal year 2021, as compared to a positive effect of $21.3 million for fiscal year 2020; offset in part by,
•An increase of $33.3 million due to favorable changes in working capital, primarily related to the timing of cash collections and cash payments;
•An increase of $43.8 million due to lower non-cash charges, primarily related to the timing of deferred tax benefits.
Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019
Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2020 was $254.6 million, a decrease of $146.8 million from $401.4 million cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2019. The net decrease was primarily due to:
•A decrease of $95.1 million due to unfavorable changes in working capital, primarily related to the timing of cash collections and cash payments; and
•A decrease of $116.5 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations; offset in part by,
•An increase of $42.4 million due to higher income before non-cash charges; and
•An increase of $22.3 million from changes in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue had a positive effect of $21.3 million on operating cash flows for fiscal year 2020, as compared to $1.1 million for fiscal year 2019.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities
Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $42.4 million, a decrease of $115.2 million from $72.7 million cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to:
•A decrease of $84.8 million in net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities and other investments; and
•A decrease of $0.4 million in cash provided by other investing activities; and
•An increase of $44.4 million in payments for business and asset acquisitions; offset in part by,
•An increase of $9.7 million in net proceeds from the disposition of businesses, primarily from the sale of our medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses; and
•A decrease of $4.8 million in cash used for capital expenditures.
Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019
Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2020 was $72.7 million, a decrease of $223.3 million from $296.0 million cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2019. The net decrease was primarily due to:
•Net proceeds of $406.9 million, primarily from the sale of our Imaging business during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019; and
•An increase of $17.1 million in cash used for capital expenditures; offset in part by,
•An increase of $179.7 million in net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities and other investments; and
•A decrease of $19.9 million in payments for business and asset acquisitions.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020
Cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $322.7 million, a decrease of $263.5 million from $586.2 million cash used in fiscal year 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to:
•A decrease of $283.6 million in cash used for the repayment and redemption of debt; and
•A decrease of $169.2 million in share repurchases; offset in part by,
•An increase of $48.1 million related to payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards; and
•An increase of $2.1 million cash used for other financing activities; and
•A net contribution of $139.1 million from Cerence in connection with the spin-off of our Automobile business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019
Cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2020 was $586.2 million, an increase of $134.2 million from $452.0 million cash used in fiscal year 2019. The net increase was primarily due to:
•An increase of $213.6 million in the repayment and redemption of debt;
•Net proceeds of $9.9 million from sale of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary in fiscal year 2019;
•An increase of $42.3 million in share repurchases;
•An increase of $4.6 million related to payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards; offset in part by,
•A net contribution of $139.1 million from Cerence in connection with the spin-off of our Automobile business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
Debt
For a detailed description of the terms and restrictions of the debt and revolving credit facility, see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we spent approximately $232.1 million in cash and issued 28.2 million shares of common stock for the redemption of debt:
•In May 2021, holders of our 1.5% 2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert $118.3 million notional amount for $118.3 million in cash and 3.5 million shares of common stock.
•During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we induced the exchange of $457.0 million notional amount of our 1.0% 2035 Debentures for $5.0 million in cash and 18.9 million shares of common stock, and $64.9 million notional amount of 1.5% 2035 Debentures for $0.5 million in cash and 3.2 million shares of common stock.
•During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, holders of our 1.5% 2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert $19.0 million notional amount for $19.0 million in cash and 0.6 million shares of common stock, and holders of our 1.0% 2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert $89.2 million notional amount for $89.2 million in cash and 2.1 million shares of common stock.
Additionally, certain debt holders have exercised their right to convert Debentures that did not settle on or prior to September 30, 2021. Holders of our 1.0% 2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert $2.3 million notional amount for $2.3 million in cash and 0.1 million shares of common stock. Additionally, holders of our 1.25% 2025 Debentures exercised
their right to convert $1.2 million notional amount for $1.2 million in cash and 0.04 million shares of common stock. The settlements of these conversions occurred subsequent to September 30, 2021, but before the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On September 29, 2021, we issued a notice calling for redemption all of our outstanding 1.5% 2035 Debentures, pursuant to which, the holders had the right to receive cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 1.5% 2035 Debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date of November 5th, 2021. In lieu of redemption, holders had the right to convert all or any portion of their debentures at the aforementioned conversion ratio until the close of business on November 4, 2021. Upon the conclusion of the conversion period on November 4, 2021, holders of $25.0 million notional amount exercised their right to convert. Additionally, we redeemed the remaining outstanding $0.1 million 1.5% 2035 Debentures for $0.1 million in cash. On November 5, 2021, we settled all of the outstanding 1.5% 2035 Debentures for $25.1 million in cash and 0.8 million shares of common stock. Following these redemptions and conversions, none of the 1.5% 2035 Debentures remain outstanding.
As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all the debt covenants. We may from time to time, depending on market and business conditions, repurchase outstanding debt in the open market or by private negotiation. We expect to incur cash interest payments of $32.9 million during fiscal year 2022. We expect to fund our debt service requirements through existing sources of liquidity and our operating cash flows.
Share Repurchases
On April 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to $500.0 million, which was increased by $500.0 million on April 29, 2015. On August 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500.0 million under our share repurchase program. Under the terms of the share repurchase program, we have the ability to repurchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. The share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The timing and the amount of any purchases are subject to our assessment of the prevailing market conditions, general economic conditions, capital allocation alternatives, and other factors.
We did not repurchase any shares during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and repurchased 9.5 million shares and 8.2 million shares for $169.2 million and $126.9 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the program. The amount paid in excess of par value is recognized in additional paid in capital and these shares were retired upon repurchase. Since the commencement of the program, we have repurchased 73.8 million shares for $1,238.8 million. The amount paid in excess of par value is recognized in additional paid in capital. Shares were retired upon repurchase. As of September 30, 2021, approximately $261.2 million remained available for future repurchases under the program.

_______________
(1) As of September 30, 2021, the holders have the right to convert all or any portion of the 1.25% 2025 Debentures, 1.5% 2035 Debentures, and 1.0% 2035 Debentures between October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. As a result, these convertible debentures were treated as if they were due in fiscal year 2022.
(2)The repayment schedule reflects the outstanding principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes due 2026 as of September 30, 2021.
(3)Interest per annum is due and payable semi-annually and is determined based on the outstanding principal as of September 30, 2021, the stated interest rate of each debt instrument and the assumed redemption dates discussed above.
(4)Letters of credit are in place primarily to secure future operating lease payments.
(5)Obligations include contractual lease commitments related to facilities that have subsequently been subleased. As of September 30, 2021, we have subleased certain facilities with total sublease income of $10.8 million through fiscal year 2027.
(6)These amounts include non-cancelable purchase commitments for property and equipment as well as inventory in the normal course of business to fulfill customer backlog. We entered into an agreement with Microsoft in October of 2019 for their Azure cloud computing service with a minimum commitment of $175.0 million. This contract is expected to be in effect through fiscal year 2024.
As of September 30, 2021, $60.1 million of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes of $1.7 million, $1.1 million, and $0.4 million during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We recorded interest and penalties of $3.5 million and $1.7 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Contingent Liabilities and Commitments
Certain acquisition payments to selling stockholders were contingent upon the achievement of predetermined performance targets over a period of time after the acquisition. Such contingent payments were recorded at estimated fair values upon the acquisition and re-measured in subsequent reporting periods. As of September 30, 2021, we do not have any requirements to pay any selling stockholders based upon the achievement of any specified performance goals. In addition, certain deferred compensation payments to selling stockholders contingent upon their continued employment after the acquisition were recorded as compensation expense over the requisite service period. Additionally, as of September 30, 2021, the remaining deferred payment obligations of $15.0 million to certain former stockholders, which are contingent upon their continued employment, will be recognized ratably as compensation expense over the remaining requisite service periods.
Microsoft Acquisition Contingent Consideration
On April 11, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Microsoft, subject to the terms of which Microsoft has agreed to acquire Nuance. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions including satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals. The Merger is currently expected to close by the end of our first quarter or early in our second quarter of fiscal year 2022. As part of the transaction, Nuance expects to incur liabilities of approximately $114.0 million that are contingent on the deal consummation. These liabilities include banker fees, legal fees, and certain retention bonuses.
Financial Instruments
We use financial instruments to manage our foreign exchange risk. We operate our business in countries throughout the world and transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operations. We have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effect of certain foreign currency exposures. Our program is designed so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. Generally, we enter into such contracts for less than 90 days and have no cash requirements until maturity. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding contracts with a total notional value of $52.5 million and $40.7 million, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans
We sponsor certain defined benefit plans that are offered primarily by our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our defined benefit pension income was $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 was $34.9 million and $35.4 million, respectively. The aggregate net liability of our defined benefit plans as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 was $10.1 million and $13.2 million, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Through September 30, 2021, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS, AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition; allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns; accounting for deferred costs; accounting for internally developed software; the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for business combinations, including contingent consideration; accounting for stock-based compensation; accounting for derivative instruments; accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances; and loss contingencies. Our management bases its estimates on historical experience, market participant fair value considerations, projected future cash flows and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments.
Revenue Recognition
We derive revenue from the following sources: (1) hosting services, (2) software licenses, including royalties, (3) maintenance and support ("M&S"), (4) professional services, and (5) sale of hardware. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax, value-added tax and other transaction taxes imposed on the related transaction including mandatory government charges that are passed through to our customers. We account for a contract when both parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and the collectibility of the consideration is probable.
The majority of our arrangements with customers typically contain multiple products and services. We account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the contract and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.
We recognize revenue after applying the following five steps:
•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•identification of the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct within the context of the contract;
•determination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;
•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.
We allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated standalone selling price ("SSP") of each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs and consider a number of data points, including:
•the pricing of standalone sales (in the instances where available);
•the pricing established by management when setting prices for deliverables that are intended to be sold on a standalone basis;
•contractually stated prices for deliverables that are intended to be sold on a standalone basis; and
•other pricing factors, such as the geographical region in which the products are sold, and expected discounts based on the customer size and type.
We only include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We reduce transaction prices for estimated returns and other allowances that represent variable consideration under ASC 606, which we estimate based on historical return experience and other relevant factors, and record a reduction to revenue and accounts receivable. Other forms of contingent revenue or variable consideration are infrequent.
Revenue is recognized when control of these products and services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
We assess the timing of the transfer of products or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18, we do not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set-up fees nor other upfront fees paid by our customers to represent a financing component.
Certain products are sold through distributors or resellers. Certain distributors and resellers have been granted right of return and selling incentives which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized. Returns and credits are estimated at the contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-10-4, we apply a portfolio approach to estimate the variable consideration associated with this group of customers.
Reimbursements for out-of-pocket costs generally include, but are not limited to, costs related to transportation, lodging and meals. Revenue from reimbursed out-of-pocket costs is accounted for as variable consideration.
Shipping and handling activities are not considered a contract performance obligation. We record shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenue with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue.
Performance Obligations
Hosting
Hosting services, which allow our customers to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a usage basis as consumed or on a fixed fee subscription basis. Our hosting contract terms generally range from one to five years.
As each day of providing services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, we have determined that our hosting services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services. These services include variable consideration, which is typically a function of usage. We recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed (i.e., recognized as incurred).
Subscription basis revenue represents a single promise to stand-ready to provide access to our hosting services. Revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the hosting contract term, which generally ranges from one to five years.
Software Licenses
On-premise software licenses sold with non-distinct professional services to customize and/or integrate the underlying software are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Revenue from the combined performance obligation is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.
Revenue from distinct on-premise software licenses, which do not require professional services to customize and/or integrate the software license, is recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer and control is transferred.
Revenue from software licenses sold on a royalty basis, where the license of intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates, is recognized in the period the usage occurs in accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-65(A).
Maintenance and Support
Our M&S contracts generally include telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis. M&S revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period because we transfer control evenly by providing a stand-ready service.
Professional Services
Revenue from distinct professional services, including training, is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.
Hardware
Hardware revenue is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery.
Significant Judgments
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Our license contracts often include professional services to customize and/or integrate the licenses into the customer’s environment. Judgment is required to determine whether the license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with professional services.
Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. When SSP is directly observable, we estimate SSP based upon the historical transaction prices, adjusted for geographic considerations, customer classes, and customer relationship profiles. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We may have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining SSP. Determining SSP for performance obligations which we never sell separately also requires significant judgment. In estimating the SSP, we consider the likely price that would have resulted from established pricing practices had the deliverable been offered separately and the prices a customer would likely be willing to pay.
From time to time, we may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e. report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e. report revenues on a net basis). In doing so, we first evaluate whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, we are the principal; if not, we are the agent. Generally, we control a promised good or service before transferring that good or service to the customer and act as the principal to the transaction. Determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer may require judgment.
Goodwill Impairment Analysis
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather the carrying amounts of these assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on July 1, the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2017, we elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” for its annual goodwill impairment test. ASU 2017-04 removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test requiring a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. There was no goodwill impairment for fiscal year 2021 and 2020.
For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component within an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management for performance assessment and resource allocation. Components of similar economic characteristics are aggregated into one reporting unit for the purpose of
goodwill impairment assessment. Reporting units are identified annually and re-assessed periodically for recent acquisitions or any changes in segment reporting structure.
Corporate assets and liabilities are allocated to each reporting unit based on the reporting unit’s revenue, total operating expenses or operating income as a percentage of the consolidated amounts. Corporate debt and other financial liabilities that are not directly attributable to the reporting unit's operations and would not be transferred to hypothetical purchasers of the reporting units are excluded from a reporting unit's carrying amount.
We evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative analysis and determined goodwill was not impaired. As part of that analysis we assessed goodwill using an entity valuation, which was derived based on the attribution of the agreed-upon purchase price for the announced Microsoft acquisition of Nuance. We use key financial metrics to allocate the purchase price to each reporting unit.
Intangible Assets and long-lived Asset groups
Long-lived assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the asset group is also a reporting unit, goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is also included in the carrying amount of the asset group. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset group’s carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group.
Income Taxes
Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not after consideration of all available evidence. As the income tax returns are not due and filed until after the completion of our annual financial reporting requirements, the amounts recorded for the current period reflect estimates for the tax-based activity for the period. In addition, estimates are often required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state and foreign income tax rates to use, the potential utilization of operating loss carry-forwards and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions.
Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.
We have historically estimated the future tax consequence of certain items, including bad debts, inventory valuation, and accruals that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are paid or the related assets are disposed. We believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law. The income tax estimates used have not resulted in material adjustments to income tax expense in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual filed tax return amounts.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, we do not accrue tax for the repatriation of such foreign earnings.
Valuation Allowance
We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need
for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. If positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income, exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, existed it would be difficult for it to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Generally, cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed.
As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, we had a full valuation allowance against net domestic deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the release of all or some portion of these allowances. A significant portion of our domestic deferred tax assets relate to U.S. net operating losses. We continue to believe negative evidence regarding the deferred tax assets outweighs positive evidence after considering recent profitability trends and the disposition of the medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses. We continue to evaluate all sources of domestic taxable income including both the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood that we could sustain pretax profitability in the future. As of September 30, 2021, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next twelve months these sources of taxable income may become sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that a substantial portion of the domestic valuation allowance, excluding capital losses, could be released.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We operate in multiple jurisdictions through wholly-owned subsidiaries and our global structure is complex. The estimates of our uncertain tax positions involve judgments and assessment of the potential tax implications related to legal entity restructuring, credits, intercompany transfer and acquisition or divestiture. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
Our tax positions are subject to audit by taxing authorities across multiple global jurisdictions and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes we may owe may differ from the amounts recognized.
